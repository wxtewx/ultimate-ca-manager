## Features

### PKI Core
- **CA Management** -- Root and intermediate CAs, hierarchy view, import/export, **HSM-backed signing keys** (private key never leaves the HSM), **configurable RFC 5280 profile** (signature digest, Key Usage, EKU) with Let's Encrypt-style defaults
- **Certificate Lifecycle** -- Issue, sign, revoke, renew, rename (mutable display name, covers CN-less certificates), export (PEM, DER, PKCS#12, JKS), bulk operations, filter by status / issuer / source (ACME, SCEP, EST, AD CS, import…)
- **Conformance Linting** -- per-certificate checks against RFC 5280 and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements via pkilint (and zlint when available), informative-only
- **CSR Management** -- Create, import, sign Certificate Signing Requests with **custom Extra EKU OIDs** (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.12), **typed SAN validation** (DNS / IP / Email / URI / UPN), NIST P-256 / P-384 / P-521 curves
- **Certificate Templates** -- Predefined profiles for server, client, code signing, email
- **Certificate Discovery** -- Network scanning, scan profiles, scheduled scans, certificate import
- **Trust Store** -- Manage trusted root CA certificates with expiry alerts

## Roadmap

- [ ] **High Availability / Clustering** — Active-passive or active-active HA deployment
- [ ] **Post-Quantum Cryptography** — ML-DSA, ML-KEM, SLH-DSA key types (NIST FIPS 203/204/205)
- [ ] **CMP Protocol (RFC 4210)** — Certificate Management Protocol support
- [x] **Security hardening, multi-endpoint SCEP, and access-control refinements** — an audit-driven hardening pass tightens issuance (per-path key-strength floor, CSR EKU capping, gated sub-CA minting), ACME (SAN types and subject bound to validated identifiers, SSRF guard on IP orders and cloud-metadata targets), and authorization (mTLS, API-key scoping, TSA, CSRF, SSH, OCSP, and direct private-key export gated behind an admin-only scope so Key Recovery's approval trail can't be bypassed); named SCEP profiles serve multiple enrollment endpoints, each with its own CA, template, challenge and approval policy; delegated OCSP responder certificates renew automatically; EAB credentials can be restricted to specific domains; and user groups can grant permissions from the UI *(v2.204)*
- [x] **Compatibility restore & configurable strictness** — the 2.200 hardening no longer breaks existing deployments: TSA, SCEP, EST, CAA and name-constraints checks default to pre-2.200-compatible behaviour with renewals graced at par, and every strictness switch (CAA enforcement, SCEP signingTime/clock skew, CT SCT embedding/require, OCSP response validity, syslog framing, OIDC ID-token verification incl. issuer/JWKS) is now configurable from the UI; certificate templates now govern the issued KU/EKU, with a `custom` type, an OCSP Signing system template and `OCSPSigning` selectable in the editor *(v2.203)*
- [x] **ACME certificate profiles, EST CA labels and RFC 7807 API errors** — clients can pick a named issuance profile advertised in the ACME directory; EST serves multiple CAs under path labels; API errors are now standard `application/problem+json` problem details while keeping the legacy keys for existing integrations *(v2.201)*
- [x] **Protocol conformance sweep** — RFC-coverage audit and fixes across ACME client/server (state machine, subproblems, TLS-ALPN-01/IP identifiers, upstream revocation, ARI `replaces`), SCEP (GetCert/GetCRL, AES + PBKDF2 encryption), EST (server-side key generation §4.4), OCSP (multi-request, delegated responder validation), CAA (RFC 8657 account/method binding), TSA, CT pre-certificate flow with embedded SCTs, and OIDC id_token verification *(v2.200)*
- [x] **ACME preferred certificate chain** — per-CA-account `preferred_chain` selects an RFC 8555 `Link: rel="alternate"` chain at download time (subject or issuer CN match, e.g. `ISRG Root X1`), in both the ACME client and proxy *(v2.193)*
- [x] **Microsoft AD CS full lifecycle** — Renew/revoke AD CS-issued certificates through the connector, plus an optional WinRM admin channel: revocation propagated to the CA, one-way CRL revocation sync, CA inventory import with reconciliation, and a control panel to approve/deny pending requests with CA health; [guide](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/wiki/Microsoft-CA-Integration) *(v2.192)*
- [x] **Key Archival & Recovery** — Dual-control recovery of archived private keys: request → admin approve (four-eyes) → PKCS#12 download, fully audited; [guide](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/wiki/Key-Recovery) *(v2.171)*
- [x] **Custom external ACME CA for issuance** — a configured custom ACME directory URL plus EAB (Settings → ACME client) is now used by issuance and renewal instead of always hitting Let's Encrypt; account row carries the directory/EAB atomically *(v2.180)*
- [x] **Multi-CA management with per-request selection** — issue from several external ACME CAs (Let's Encrypt, Actalis, ZeroSSL, Google Trust Services, HARICA…); each request picks its CA, the order is pinned to that account so renewals stay on the same authority; CRUD UI for CA accounts with per-account EAB and default selection *(v2.181)*
- [x] **Multi-CA ACME proxy endpoints** — each external CA account can expose its own proxy path at `/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory` alongside the legacy default endpoint, with per-account upstream credentials *(v2.185)*
- [x] **ACME external CSR, renewal key reuse & staging preflight** — finalize with an externally generated CSR (key never enters UCM), keep the same private key across renewals (DANE/TLSA), and dry-run requests against Let's Encrypt staging before touching production rate limits *(v2.184)*
- [x] **Code Signing** — Issue and manage code-signing certificates for Authenticode, JAR and macOS via the `codeSigning` EKU plus platform key purposes (kernel-mode, lifetime, Apple Developer ID); [usage guide](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/wiki/Code-Signing) *(v2.171)*
- [x] **Helm chart** — Package UCM itself as a Helm chart for in-cluster deployment under `charts/ucm/` (single-instance, persistent `master.key`, SQLite or external PostgreSQL) *(v2.171)*
- [x] **SAN database columns derived from final SAN list** — `san_email` / `san_dns` / `san_ip` / `san_uri` always match the X.509 extension, with backfill migration *(v2.140)*
- [x] **On-disk certificate & CA files** — `.crt` / `.key` materialized to disk on every creation path *(v2.140)*
- [x] **ACME External Account Binding (EAB, RFC 8555 §7.3.4)** — Issue/rotate/revoke `kid`+`hmac` pairs for cert-manager / certbot / acme.sh *(v2.139)*
- [x] **ACME custom DNS resolvers + private-IP validation** — Split-horizon DNS, RFC1918/`.lan`/`.local` HTTP-01 & TLS-ALPN-01 *(v2.139)*
- [x] **Kubernetes / cert-manager integration** — Reference manifests for ClusterIssuer (HTTP-01 + DNS-01 with EAB) *(v2.139)*
- [x] **SMTP OAuth2 (XOAUTH2)** — Gmail, Outlook.com, Microsoft 365 modern auth *(v2.134)*
- [x] **SSO `auth_source` tracking + role preservation** — Per-user origin, optional sync-on-login, UI never overwritten *(v2.133)*
- [x] **HSM-backed Certificate Authorities** — Signing key generated/stored in HSM, never exportable *(v2.130)*
- [x] **Native PostgreSQL backend** — Bidirectional migration UI with safety checks *(v2.127)*
- [x] **PostgreSQL feature parity** — Database stats, optimize, integrity check, certificate activity chart all work natively on PostgreSQL *(v2.135)*
- [x] **Custom Extra EKU OIDs** — Microsoft RDP, smartcard logon, document signing, IPsec, Kerberos PKINIT… (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.12) *(v2.128)*
- [x] **Persisted UI filters** — Filter selections survive reloads on every list page *(v2.128)*
- [x] **User preferences server-side** — Language/theme follow the user across browsers *(v2.128)*
- [x] **Windows SSH CA setup script (`.ps1`)** — One-command trust setup for Windows OpenSSH Server *(v2.128/v2.134)*
- [x] **SSH Certificates** — SSH CA management, host/user certificate signing, import, setup scripts *(v2.112)*
