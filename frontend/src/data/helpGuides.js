## Overview

The Dashboard is your central monitoring hub. It displays real-time metrics, charts, and alerts about your entire PKI infrastructure through customizable widgets.

## Widgets

### Statistics Card
Displays four key counters:
- **Total CAs** — Root and Intermediate Certificate Authorities
- **Active Certificates** — Valid, non-revoked certificates
- **Pending CSRs** — Certificate Signing Requests awaiting approval
- **Expiring Soon** — Certificates expiring within 30 days

### Certificate Trend
A line chart showing certificate issuance over time. Hover over data points to see exact counts.

### Status Distribution
Pie chart showing the breakdown of certificate states:
- **Valid** — Within validity period and not revoked
- **Expiring** — Expires within 30 days
- **Expired** — Past the "Not After" date
- **Revoked** — Explicitly revoked

### Next Expiry
Lists certificates expiring soonest. Click any certificate to navigate to its details. Configure the threshold in **Settings → General**.

### System Status
Shows the health of UCM services:
- ACME server (enabled/disabled)
- SCEP server
- EST protocol (enabled/disabled, assigned CA)
- CRL auto-regeneration with CDP count
- OCSP responder
- Auto-renewal status
- Service uptime

### Recent Activity
A live feed of the latest operations: certificate issuance, revocations, imports, user logins. Updates in real-time via WebSocket.

### Certificate Authorities
Quick view of all CAs with their type (Root/Intermediate) and certificate count.

### ACME Accounts
Lists registered ACME client accounts and their order counts.

## Customization

### Rearranging Widgets
Drag any widget by its header to reposition it. The layout uses a responsive grid that adapts to your screen size.

### Showing/Hiding Widgets
Click the **eye icon** in the page header to toggle individual widget visibility. Hidden widgets are remembered across sessions.

### Layout Persistence
Your layout configuration is saved per-user in the browser. It persists across sessions and devices sharing the same browser profile.

## Overview

Certificate Authorities (CAs) form the foundation of your PKI. UCM supports multi-level CA hierarchies with Root CAs, Intermediate CAs, and Sub-CAs.

## CA Types

### Root CA
A self-signed certificate that serves as the trust anchor. Root CAs should ideally be kept offline in production environments. In UCM, a Root CA has no parent.

### Intermediate CA
Signed by a Root CA or another Intermediate CA. Used for day-to-day certificate signing. Intermediate CAs limit the blast radius if compromised.

### Sub-CA
Any CA signed by an Intermediate CA, creating deeper hierarchy levels.

## Views

### Tree View
Displays the full CA hierarchy as a collapsible tree. Parent-child relationships are visualized with indentation and connecting lines.

### List View
Flat table with sortable columns: Name, Type, Status, Certificates issued, Expiry date.

### Organization View
Groups CAs by their Organization (O) field. Useful for multi-tenant setups where different departments manage separate CA trees.

## Creating a CA

### Create Root CA
1. Click **Create** → **Root CA**
2. Fill in the Subject fields (CN, O, OU, C, ST, L)
3. Select the key algorithm (RSA 2048/4096, ECDSA P-256/P-384)
4. Set the validity period (typically 10-20 years for Root CAs)
5. Optionally select a certificate template
6. Click **Create**

### Create Intermediate CA
1. Click **Create** → **Intermediate CA**
2. Select the **Parent CA** (must have a private key)
3. Fill in Subject fields
4. Set the validity period (typically 5-10 years)
5. Click **Create**

> ⚠ The Intermediate CA validity cannot exceed its parent CA's validity.

## Importing a CA

Import existing CA certificates via:
- **PEM file** — Certificate in PEM format
- **DER file** — Binary DER format
- **PKCS#12** — Certificate + private key bundle (requires password)

When importing without a private key, the CA can verify certificates but cannot sign new ones.

## Exporting a CA

Export formats:
- **PEM** — Base64-encoded certificate
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#12 (P12/PFX)** — Certificate + private key + chain, password-protected

> 💡 PKCS#12 export includes the full certificate chain and is ideal for backup.

## Private Keys

CAs with a **key icon** (🔑) have a private key stored in UCM and can sign certificates. CAs without a key are trust-only — they validate chains but cannot issue.

### Key Storage
Private keys are encrypted at rest in the UCM database. For higher security, consider using an HSM provider (see HSM page).

## Chain Repair

If parent-child relationships are broken (e.g., after import), use **Chain Repair** to automatically rebuild the hierarchy based on Issuer/Subject matching.

## Renewing a CA

Renewing re-issues the CA certificate with:
- Same subject and key
- New validity period
- New serial number

Existing certificates signed by the CA remain valid.

## Deleting a CA

> ⚠ Deleting a CA removes it from UCM but does NOT revoke certificates it has issued. Revoke certificates first if needed.

Deletion is blocked if the CA has child CAs. Delete or re-parent children first.

## HSM-backed CAs

UCM can store a CA's signing key on an external Hardware Security Module instead of the local encrypted database. This is the recommended option for production Root and Intermediate CAs.

### When to use
- Compliance requirements (FIPS 140-2/3, eIDAS, Common Criteria)
- Defense-in-depth: keys cannot be exfiltrated even if the UCM host is compromised
- Centralized key custody across multiple PKI tools

### Prerequisites
1. Open **HSM Management** and configure a provider (PKCS#11 / OpenBao / etc.)
2. Verify the provider is **Active** and **Connected**

### Step by step
1. Open **Create CA**
2. Fill in the Subject and validity as usual
3. In **Key Storage**, switch from *Local* to **HSM**
4. Pick the HSM provider
5. Choose a key mode:
   - **Generate new key** — provide a label (letters/digits/_/-) and pick the algorithm (RSA-2048/3072/4096 or EC-P256/P384/P521)
   - **Use existing key** — pick an unused signing key already present on the HSM
6. Submit. UCM creates the CA certificate and binds it to the HSM key.

### Limitations
- HSM-backed private keys **cannot be exported**. PKCS#12, JKS and key-only export options are hidden for HSM CAs. Only the certificate (PEM/DER/P7B) can be exported.
- There is **no in-place migration** between Local and HSM. To "move" an existing local CA onto an HSM, create a new CA on the HSM and re-issue certificates.
- Existing keys offered in *Use existing key* are filtered to signing-capable asymmetric keys not yet bound to another CA.

## Offline Mode

Take a CA's signing key out of runtime use without deleting the CA. The certificate, chain, CRL and OCSP responder keep working — only signing operations (CSR sign, certificate issue, CA renew) are blocked.

This is the standard way to protect a Root CA between rare ceremonies, while keeping its trust anchor and revocation infrastructure online.

### Two modes

**Password protected** — the private key stays in the UCM database, wrapped (PKCS#8) under a password you choose. To bring the CA back online, click **Restore** and re-enter the password. Fast and convenient; security depends on the password's strength and on UCM not being compromised.

**File exported** — the private key is exported as a password-encrypted PEM file that downloads once. The key is then **removed from the database**. To bring the CA back online, click **Restore**, upload the file and enter the password. This is the strongest option (true air-gap) but you are fully responsible for the file: lose it and the key is unrecoverable.

### Password rules
The password follows the standard UCM password complexity policy: minimum length, mix of character classes, no trivial sequences. The same rules as user passwords.

### Step by step — Take offline
1. Open the CA detail panel
2. Click **Take offline**
3. Read the explanation, click **Continue**
4. Pick a mode (*Password protected* or *File exported*)
5. Enter the password twice
6. Confirm. For *File exported*, the encrypted key downloads immediately — store it safely.

### Step by step — Restore
1. Open the offline CA's detail panel
2. Click **Restore**
3. Enter the password
4. For *File exported*: also select the previously downloaded key file
5. Confirm. Signing operations resume immediately.

### Effect on operations
| Operation | Online | Offline |
|---|---|---|
| Issue certificate | Allowed | **Blocked** |
| Sign CSR | Allowed | **Blocked** |
| Renew CA | Allowed | **Blocked** |
| Renew issued certificate | Allowed | **Blocked** |
| Serve CRL / OCSP | Allowed | Allowed (cached signature) |
| Export certificate / chain | Allowed | Allowed |
| Delete CA | Allowed | Allowed |

> ⚠ Offline-mode passwords are **not recoverable**. Store them in your password manager / vault before confirming. Lost password = unusable CA = full re-issuance of subordinate hierarchy.

## Overview

Central management for all X.509 certificates. Issue new certificates, import existing ones, track expiry dates, handle renewals and revocations.

## Certificate Status

- **Valid** — Within validity period and not revoked
- **Expiring** — Will expire within 30 days (configurable)
- **Expired** — Past the "Not After" date
- **Revoked** — Explicitly revoked, published in CRL
- **Orphan** — Issuing CA no longer exists in UCM

## Issuing a Certificate

1. Click **Issue Certificate**
2. Select the **Signing CA** (must have a private key)
3. Fill in the Subject (CN is required, other fields optional)
4. Add Subject Alternative Names (SANs): DNS names, IPs, emails
5. Choose key type and size
6. Set validity period
7. Optionally apply a **Template** to pre-fill settings
8. Click **Issue**

### Using Templates
Templates pre-fill Key Usage, Extended Key Usage, subject defaults, and validity. Select a template before filling the form to save time.

## Importing Certificates

Supported formats:
- **PEM** — Single or bundled certificates
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#12 (P12/PFX)** — Certificate + key + chain (password required)
- **PKCS#7 (P7B)** — Certificate chain without keys

## Renewing a Certificate

Renewal creates a new certificate with:
- Same Subject and SANs
- New key pair (generated automatically)
- New validity period
- New serial number

The original certificate remains valid until it expires or is revoked.

## Revoking a Certificate

1. Select the certificate → **Revoke**
2. Choose a revocation reason (Key Compromise, CA Compromise, Affiliation Changed, Superseded, Cessation of Operation, Certificate Hold, etc.)
3. Confirm the revocation

Revoked certificates are published in the CRL on next regeneration.

> ⚠ Revocation is generally permanent — except for **Certificate Hold** which can be removed.

### Remove Hold (Unhold)

If a certificate was revoked with the **Certificate Hold** reason, it can be restored to valid status:

1. Open the revoked certificate details
2. The **Remove Hold** button appears in the action bar (only for Certificate Hold revocations)
3. Click **Remove Hold** to restore the certificate
4. The certificate returns to valid status, the CRL is regenerated, and the OCSP cache is updated

> 💡 Certificate Hold is useful for temporary suspensions (e.g., lost device, pending investigation).

### Revoke & Replace
Combines revocation with immediate re-issuance. The new certificate inherits the same Subject and SANs.

## Exporting Certificates

Export formats:
- **PEM** — Certificate only
- **PEM + Chain** — Certificate with full issuer chain
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#12** — Certificate + key + chain, password-protected

> ⚠ Exporting the **private key** (PKCS#12/PFX, JKS, or key file) requires the admin-only **read:private_keys** permission. Roles without it — including the built-in Operator role — must retrieve archived keys through the approval-gated **Key Recovery** workflow instead.

## Favorites

Star ⭐ important certificates to bookmark them. Favorites appear first in filtered views and are accessible from the favorites filter.

## Comparing Certificates

Select two certificates and click **Compare** to see a side-by-side diff of their Subject, SANs, Key Usage, validity, and extensions.

## Filtering & Search

- **Status filter** — Valid, Expiring, Expired, Revoked, Orphan
- **CA filter** — Show certificates from a specific CA
- **Source filter** — Filter by how the certificate entered UCM (issued, imported, ACME, SCEP, etc.)
- **Template filter** — Find certificates **modified from template**: issued from a template but with the key type, validity, or digest explicitly overridden at request time. The divergent fields are listed on the certificate detail; the record is frozen at issuance
- **Text search** — Search by CN, serial number, or SAN
- **Sorting** — By name, expiry date, creation date, status

## Conformance linting

The **Lint** action (certificate detail) checks X.509 standards conformance. Informative only.

- **RFC 5280** — IETF X.509 profile, always relevant
- **CA/Browser Forum** — Baseline Requirements for public TLS certs (expect noise on internal PKI)
- Severities: fatal / error / warning / notice / info
- Engine: pkilint (+ zlint when present) — optional server dependency, degrades gracefully when absent

## Overview

The User Certificates page manages mTLS client certificates enrolled via the **Account → mTLS** tab. Unlike regular certificates, these are specifically tied to user accounts for mutual TLS authentication.

Certificates here are fully managed by UCM — they are stored in the database with private keys, and can be exported, revoked, or deleted at any time.

## Enrolling a Certificate

1. Go to **Account → mTLS** tab
2. Click **Enroll Certificate**
3. The system generates a key pair and issues a client certificate signed by your mTLS CA
4. The certificate appears on this page and can be used for mTLS login

## Certificate Status

- **Valid** — Within validity period and not revoked
- **Expiring** — Will expire within 30 days
- **Expired** — Past the "Not After" date
- **Revoked** — Explicitly revoked, published in CRL

## Exporting a Certificate

1. Select a certificate → **Export**
2. Choose format:
   - **PEM** — Certificate + private key + CA chain in text format
   - **PKCS#12** — Binary bundle, password-protected (min 8 characters)
3. Click **Download**

The exported file can be imported into browsers, operating systems, or API clients for mTLS authentication.

> ⚠ PKCS#12 password must be at least 8 characters.

## Revoking a Certificate

1. Select a certificate → **Revoke**
2. Choose a revocation reason:
   - Key Compromise
   - Affiliation Changed
   - Superseded
   - Cessation of Operation
   - Unspecified
3. Confirm the revocation

> ⚠ Revoking a certificate immediately prevents mTLS login with that certificate. Revocation is permanent.

## Deleting a Certificate

Delete removes both the certificate and the user-certificate association. Only admins and operators can delete.

> ⚠ Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Permissions

| Role | View | Export | Revoke | Delete |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|

  // ===================================================================
  csrs: {
    title: 'Certificate Signing Requests',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) allow external systems to request certificates without exposing their private keys. The CSR contains the public key and subject information; the private key stays with the requester.

## Tabs

### Pending
CSRs awaiting review and signing. New CSRs appear here after upload.

### History
Previously signed or rejected CSRs, with links to the resulting certificates.

## Generating a CSR

UCM can generate a CSR and key pair directly:

1. Click **Generate CSR**
2. Fill in the Subject fields (CN required)
3. Add Subject Alternative Names if needed
4. Select key type and size (RSA 2048/4096, ECDSA P-256/P-384)
5. Click **Generate**

The CSR and private key are created and stored in UCM. The CSR appears in the Pending tab ready for signing.

> 💡 This is convenient when you want UCM to manage the entire lifecycle — CSR, signing, and key storage.

## Uploading a CSR

1. Click **Upload CSR**
2. Either paste PEM text or upload a PEM/DER file
3. UCM validates the CSR signature and displays the details
4. The CSR appears in the Pending tab

## Reviewing a CSR

Click a CSR to view:
- **Subject** — CN, O, OU, C, etc.
- **SANs** — DNS names, IP addresses, emails
- **Key info** — Algorithm, size, public key fingerprint
- **Signature** — Algorithm and validity

## Signing a CSR

### Local CA Signing

1. Select a pending CSR
2. Click **Sign**
3. Choose the **Signing CA** (must have a private key)
4. Select the **Certificate Type** (server, client, code signing, email)
5. Set the **validity period** in days
5. Optionally apply a template for Key Usage and extensions
6. Click **Sign**

The resulting certificate appears in the Certificates page.

### Microsoft CA Signing

If Microsoft CA connections are configured, a **Microsoft CA** tab appears in the sign modal:

1. Select a pending CSR and click **Sign**
2. Switch to the **Microsoft CA** tab
3. Select the **MS CA connection**
4. Select the **certificate template** (auto-loaded from the CA)
5. Click **Sign**

If the template requires manager approval, UCM tracks the pending request. Check its status from the CSR detail panel.

### Enroll on Behalf Of (EOBO)

When signing via Microsoft CA, you can enroll on behalf of another user:

1. Select the MS CA connection and template
2. Check **Enroll on Behalf Of (EOBO)**
3. The **Enrollee DN** and **Enrollee UPN** fields auto-fill from the CSR subject and SAN email
4. Adjust the values if needed and click **Sign**

> ⚠️ EOBO requires an enrollment agent certificate configured on the AD CS server, and the template must allow enrollment on behalf of other users.

## Adding a Private Key

After signing, you can attach a private key to the certificate for PKCS#12 export. Click **Add Key** on the signed certificate.

> 💡 This is useful when the requester sends both the CSR and the key securely.

## Deleting CSRs

Delete removes the CSR from UCM. If the CSR was already signed, the resulting certificate is not affected.
`

  // ===================================================================
  templates: {
    title: 'Certificate Templates',
    content: `
## Overview

Templates define reusable certificate profiles. Instead of manually configuring Key Usage, Extended Key Usage, validity, and subject fields each time, apply a template to pre-fill everything.

## Template Types

### End-Entity Templates
For server certificates, client certificates, code signing, and email protection. These templates typically set:
- **Key Usage** — Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
- **Extended Key Usage** — Server Auth, Client Auth, Code Signing, Email Protection

### CA Templates
For creating Intermediate CAs. These set:
- **Key Usage** — Certificate Sign, CRL Sign
- **Basic Constraints** — CA:TRUE, optional path length

## Creating a Template

1. Click **Create Template**
2. Enter a **name** and optional description
3. Select the template **type** (End-Entity or CA)
4. Configure **Subject defaults** (O, OU, C, ST, L)
5. Select **Key Usage** flags
6. Select **Extended Key Usage** values
7. Set the **default validity** period in days
8. Click **Create**

## Using Templates

When issuing a certificate or signing a CSR, select a template from the dropdown. The template pre-fills:
- Subject fields (you can override them)
- Key Usage and Extended Key Usage
- Validity period

## Windows Autoenrollment Flags

Templates carry three opt-in flags used by the Windows autoenrollment protocols (XCEP/WSTEP, configured under **Settings → Windows Autoenrollment**):

- **Allow autoenrollment** — Advertise the template as \`autoEnroll=true\` in Certificate Enrollment Policy, so GPO/Kerberos-authenticated clients request it automatically at logon with no user action. Off by default — like real ADCS, a template can still be enrolled manually (MMC "Request New Certificate", \`certreq\`) without this, since Enroll and Autoenroll are separate permissions.
- **Build subject from Active Directory** — For unattended GPO autoenrollment: derive the certificate's subject and SAN from the requester's AD object (via the AD Connector) instead of requiring the client to supply one.
- **Restrict enrollment to AD group** — Only principals belonging to the configured Active Directory group (nested membership included) may enroll against this template over the Kerberos-authenticated endpoint. Enter a group name or full DN; leave blank to allow any authenticated principal, matching real ADCS's default. Not enforced on the Username/Password endpoint, which has no per-request identity to check.

Templates with these flags show **AD**, **Auto**, and **ACL** badges in the template list.

## Pinned Subject Fields

A template can **pin** the organizational subject fields — **C, ST, L, O, OU** — for certificates issued over WSTEP. A pinned value is forced onto every issued certificate, overriding whatever the client's CSR or the Active Directory derivation supplies for that field.

- **Common Name and Subject Alternative Name are never affected** — they stay dynamic per requester
- Leave a field blank to leave it dynamic
- Templates with pinned fields show a **Pinned** badge, and the pinned values appear in the template detail panel

Use this to guarantee a uniform organizational identity (e.g. a fixed \`O\` and \`C\`) across an autoenrolled fleet, regardless of what each Windows client submits.

## Duplicating Templates

Click **Duplicate** to create a copy of an existing template. Modify the copy without affecting the original.

## Import & Export

### Export
Export templates as JSON for sharing between UCM instances.

### Import
Import from:
- **JSON file** — Upload a template JSON file
- **JSON paste** — Paste JSON directly into the text area

## Common Template Examples

  // ===================================================================
  crlocsp: {
    title: 'CRL & OCSP',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allow clients to verify whether a certificate has been revoked. UCM supports both mechanisms.

## CRL Management

### What is a CRL?
A CRL is a signed list of revoked certificate serial numbers, published by a CA. Clients download the CRL and check if a certificate's serial number appears in it.

### CRL per CA
Each CA has its own CRL. The CRL list shows all your CAs with:
- **Revoked count** — Number of certificates in the CRL
- **Last regenerated** — When the CRL was last rebuilt
- **Auto-regeneration** — Whether automatic CRL updates are enabled

### Regenerating a CRL
Click **Regenerate** to rebuild a CA's CRL immediately. This is useful after revoking certificates.

### Auto-Regeneration
Enable auto-regeneration to automatically rebuild the CRL whenever a certificate is revoked. Toggle this per CA.

### CRL Validity
The CRL schedule (per CA) sets how long each published CRL remains valid. Options range from **1 day to 5 years**: 1d, 2d, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d, 90d, 180d, 1y, 3y, 5y.

- **Online CAs** should keep a short validity (days) so relying parties pick up revocations quickly
- **Offline CAs** (typically a Root that cannot re-sign CRLs on schedule) are the intended use case for the long options — 90d up to 5y
- A warning is shown past one year: relying parties may keep stale revocation data for the whole validity window

### CRL Distribution Point (CDP)
The CDP URL is embedded in certificates so clients know where to download the CRL. Copy the URL from the CRL details.

\`\`\`
http://your-server:8080/cdp/{ca_refid}.crl
\`\`\`

> 💡 **Auto-enabled**: When you create a new CA, CDP is automatically enabled if a Protocol Base URL or HTTP protocol server is configured. The CDP URL is auto-generated — no manual steps needed.

> ⚠️ **Important**: URLs are auto-generated using the HTTP protocol port and server FQDN. If you access UCM via \`localhost\`, the URL cannot be generated. Configure your **FQDN** or **Protocol Base URL** in Settings → General first.

### Downloading CRLs
Download CRLs in DER or PEM format for distribution to clients or integration with other systems.

## OCSP Responder

### What is OCSP?
OCSP provides real-time certificate status checking. Instead of downloading an entire CRL, clients send a query for a specific certificate and get an immediate response.

### OCSP Status
The OCSP section shows:
- **Responder status** — Active or inactive per CA
- **Total queries** — Number of OCSP requests processed
- **Cache** — Response cache with automatic daily cleanup of expired entries

### OCSP Cache

UCM caches OCSP responses for performance. The cache is:
- **Automatically cleaned** — Expired responses are purged daily by the scheduler
- **Invalidated on revocation** — When a certificate is revoked, its cached OCSP response is immediately cleared
- **Invalidated on unhold** — When a Certificate Hold is removed, the OCSP cache is updated

### Delegated OCSP Responder

By default, OCSP responses are signed with the CA key itself. A **delegated responder** uses a dedicated certificate with the **OCSPSigning** EKU instead — assign one per CA from the CA's detail panel (only certificates carrying the OCSPSigning EKU and a private key are eligible).

**Automatic renewal**: a daily task re-issues the responder certificate before it expires — same key pair and extensions, renewed at par — and rebinds the CA's responder configuration to the new certificate. Short-lived OCSP signing certificates (e.g. a 90-day template) rotate without manual action. Enabled by default; it can be disabled and the renewal window tuned via configuration.

### AIA URLs
The Authority Information Access (AIA) extension is embedded in certificates to tell clients where to find:

**OCSP Responder** — real-time revocation checking:
\`\`\`
http://your-server:8080/ocsp
\`\`\`

**CA Issuers** (RFC 5280 §4.2.2.1) — download the issuing CA certificate for chain building:
\`\`\`
http://your-server:8080/ca/{ca_refid}.cer   (DER format)
http://your-server:8080/ca/{ca_refid}.pem   (PEM format)
\`\`\`

Enable CA Issuers per CA in the **AIA CA Issuers** section of the detail panel. The URL is automatically generated using the HTTP protocol server and the configured FQDN.

> ⚠️ **Prerequisite**: Protocol URLs (CDP, OCSP, AIA) require a valid **FQDN** or a configured **Protocol Base URL** in Settings → General. If you access UCM via \`localhost\`, enabling these features will fail — set the FQDN first.

### OCSP vs CRL

| Feature | CRL | OCSP |
|---------|-----|------|
| Update frequency | Periodic | Real-time |
| Bandwidth | Full list each time | Single query |
| Privacy | No tracking | Server sees queries |
| Offline support | Yes (cached) | Requires connectivity |

> 💡 Best practice: enable both CRL and OCSP for maximum compatibility.

    title: 'SCEP Server',
    content: `
## Overview

The Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) enables network devices — routers, switches, firewalls, MDM-managed endpoints — to automatically request and obtain certificates.

## Tabs

### Requests
View all SCEP enrollment requests:
- **Pending** — Awaiting manual approval (if auto-approve is off)
- **Approved** — Successfully issued
- **Rejected** — Denied by an administrator

### Configuration
Configure the SCEP server:
- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle the SCEP service
- **Signing CA** — Select which CA signs SCEP-enrolled certificates
- **CA Identifier** — The identifier devices use to locate the correct CA
- **Auto-Approve** — Automatically approve requests with valid challenge passwords

### Profiles
Named enrollment endpoints, each served at its own URL:

\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/scep/<profile>/pkiclient.exe
\`\`\`

Each profile is bound to:
- **Its own CA** — different device fleets can enroll against different CAs
- **An optional certificate template** — when bound, the template's key usage, extended key usage and validity govern every certificate issued through the profile
- **A per-profile challenge password** — stored encrypted, with the same expiry window as the global challenge (or Microsoft Intune validation, see below)
- **An approval policy** — auto-approve or manual review per profile

Point each device fleet, MDM profile, or tenant at its own profile URL. The unlabelled \`/scep/pkiclient.exe\` endpoint keeps serving the global configuration unchanged.

### Challenge Passwords
Manage per-CA challenge passwords. Devices must include a valid challenge password in their enrollment request to authenticate.

- **View password** — Show the current challenge for a CA
- **Regenerate** — Create a new challenge password (invalidates the old one)

### Information
Displays the SCEP endpoint URL and integration instructions.

## SCEP Enrollment Flow

1. Device sends a **GetCACert** request to get the CA certificate
2. Device generates a key pair and creates a CSR
3. Device wraps the CSR with the **challenge password** and sends a **PKCSReq**
4. UCM validates the challenge password
5. If auto-approve is on, UCM signs and returns the certificate
6. If auto-approve is off, an admin reviews and approves/rejects

## SCEP URLs

\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/scep                          (global endpoint)
https://your-server:8443/scep/<profile>/pkiclient.exe  (per-profile endpoint)
\`\`\`

Devices need the URL plus the CA identifier to enroll. Use a profile URL to target that profile's CA, template and challenge password.

## Approving/Rejecting Requests

For pending requests (auto-approve disabled):
1. Review the request details (subject, key type, challenge)
2. Click **Approve** to sign and issue the certificate
3. Or click **Reject** with a reason

> ⚠ Challenge passwords are transmitted in the SCEP request. Always use HTTPS for the SCEP endpoint.

## Device Integration

### Cisco IOS
\`\`\`
crypto pki trustpoint UCM
  enrollment url https://your-server:8443/scep
  password <challenge-password>
\`\`\`

### JAMF
Configure the SCEP profile with:
- Server URL: \`https://your-server:8443/scep\`
- Challenge: the password from UCM

### Microsoft Intune
Intune doesn't support a static challenge password — it issues its own encrypted, per-device challenge that only Intune's API can validate. On a SCEP **profile** (not the global endpoint), enable **Microsoft Intune SCEP challenge validation** and provide an Entra app registration's tenant ID, client ID and client secret:

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, register an app and grant it **Intune API → SCEP challenge validation** (\`scep_challenge_provider\`) and **Microsoft Graph → Application.Read.All**, both application permissions, admin-consented
2. Enter the tenant ID, client ID and client secret on the profile, then **Test Connection** to confirm UCM can reach Intune before saving
3. In Intune, point the device SCEP profile's server URL at this profile's \`/scep/<segment>/pkiclient.exe\` endpoint

Intune-enabled profiles must have **Auto-Approve** on — Intune's enrollment flow is a synchronous validate-then-issue round trip, with no queue on Intune's side for a human to review.

    title: 'ACME',
    content: `
## Overview

UCM supports ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) in two modes:

- **ACME Client** — Obtain certificates from any RFC 8555-compliant CA (Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, Buypass, HARICA, or custom)
- **Local ACME Server** — Built-in ACME server for internal PKI automation with multi-CA support

## ACME Client

### Client Settings
Manage your ACME client configuration:
- **Environment** — Staging (testing) or Production (live certificates)
- **Contact Email** — Required for account registration
- **Auto-Renewal** — Automatically renew certificates before expiry
- **Certificate Key Type** — RSA-2048, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, or ECDSA P-384
- **Account Key Algorithm** — ES256, ES384, or RS256 for ACME account signing

### Custom ACME Server
Use any RFC 8555-compliant CA, not just Let's Encrypt:

| CA Provider | Directory URL |
|---|---|
| **Let's Encrypt** | *(default, leave empty)* |
| **ZeroSSL** | \`https://acme.zerossl.com/v2/DV90\` |
| **Buypass** | \`https://api.buypass.com/acme/directory\` |
| **HARICA** | \`https://acme-v02.harica.gr/acme/<token>/directory\` |
| **Google Trust** | \`https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory\` |

Set your CA's directory URL in **Settings** → **Custom ACME Server**.

### External CA Accounts
Manage every external CA account UCM registers with:

- **Multiple accounts per CA allowed** — several accounts can share the same directory URL (e.g. two Let's Encrypt accounts with different contact emails for administrative separation, useful alongside dns-persist-01). The account row, not the URL, is the identity.
- **Empty Directory URL** — defaults to Let's Encrypt Production.
- **Default account** — picked when a request selects no CA account; URL-based lookups resolve to the default.
- **Import** — bring an existing account's private key at creation: PKCS#8, SEC1/X9.62 (\`BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY\`) and PKCS#1 (\`BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\`) envelopes are all accepted; the algorithm is derived automatically.
- **Per-account proxy endpoint** — each account can expose \`/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory\` with its own slug.

### External Account Binding (EAB)
Some CAs require EAB credentials to link your ACME account with an existing account at the CA:

1. Register at your CA's portal to obtain **EAB Key ID** and **HMAC Key**
2. Enter both values in **Settings** → **Custom ACME Server**
3. The HMAC key is base64url-encoded (provided by the CA)

> 💡 EAB is required by ZeroSSL, HARICA, Google Trust Services, and most enterprise CAs.

### ECDSA vs RSA Keys

| Key Type | Size | Security | Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RSA-2048** | 2048 bit | Standard | Baseline |
| **RSA-4096** | 4096 bit | Higher | Slower |
| **ECDSA P-256** | 256 bit | ≈ RSA-3072 | Much faster |
| **ECDSA P-384** | 384 bit | ≈ RSA-7680 | Faster |

ECDSA keys are recommended for modern deployments — smaller, faster, and equally secure.

### Key Source
When requesting a certificate, choose where the private key comes from:

- **Generate new key** *(default)* — UCM creates a fresh key pair for each order
- **Reuse key on renewal** — keep the same private key across renewals (needed for DANE/TLSA records and key pinning); the first issuance generates the key, renewals reload it
- **Provide external CSR** — paste a PEM CSR generated elsewhere; UCM submits it at finalize and the private key never enters UCM. CSR domains must exactly match the order identifiers

### Preflight (dry run)
**Run Preflight** on the request form validates the whole request against the Let's Encrypt **staging** directory, without consuming production rate limits:

- Checks domain syntax, contact email, ACME account / EAB and CA connectivity
- **Full** mode creates a staging order and previews the exact \`_acme-challenge\` TXT records to publish
- **Validate only** checks configuration and connectivity without creating an order
- Optionally verifies DNS TXT propagation after you added the records

> 💡 Custom CAs have no staging endpoint — preflight then validates configuration and connectivity only.

### DNS Providers
Configure DNS-01 challenge providers for domain validation. Supported providers include:
- Cloudflare
- AWS Route 53
- Azure DNS
- Google Cloud DNS
- DigitalOcean
- OVH
- Tencent Cloud DNSPod
- And more

Each provider requires API credentials specific to the DNS service.

#### Custom Command provider
For DNS services without a native driver, the **Custom Command** provider runs admin-configured local commands for TXT record create/delete. Record details are passed as environment variables:

- \`DOMAIN\` — base domain being validated
- \`RECORD_NAME\` — full TXT record name (\`_acme-challenge.example.com\`)
- \`RECORD_VALUE\` — TXT content (challenge digest)
- \`TTL\` — record TTL in seconds
- \`ACTION\` — \`create\` or \`delete\`

The command requires an **absolute binary path**, runs without a shell (no pipes or expansion), and is killed after a configurable timeout (5–300 s, default 60). Use a small wrapper script to bridge any external DNS tooling.

### Custom DNS Resolvers
Optionally override the resolvers used to verify \`_acme-challenge\` TXT records (useful for split-horizon DNS or to avoid public-resolver caching). Entries are comma-separated and accept plain IPs or \`host:port\` — e.g. a loopback-only BIND or a dnsmasq instance on an alternate port.

### Domains
Map your domains to DNS providers. When requesting a certificate for a domain, UCM uses the mapped provider to create DNS-01 challenge records.

1. Click **Add Domain**
2. Enter the domain name (e.g., \`example.com\` or \`*.example.com\`)
3. Select the DNS provider
4. Click **Save**

> 💡 Wildcard certificates (\`*.example.com\`) require DNS-01 validation.

## ACME Proxy Mode

ACME Proxy lets internal clients request certificates from a public CA (Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, etc.) through UCM, without direct internet access. UCM acts as an intermediary, handling DNS-01 challenges and forwarding requests to the upstream CA.

### When to Use Proxy Mode
- Internal servers that cannot reach the internet directly
- Centralized DNS-01 challenge handling through UCM's configured DNS providers
- Audit and tracking of all public certificate issuance

### Configuration
1. Go to **ACME** → **Let's Encrypt** tab
2. Scroll down to the **ACME Proxy** section
3. Enable the **ACME Proxy** toggle
4. Select an **Upstream CA account** from **External CA Accounts** (Let's Encrypt, Actalis, ZeroSSL, custom directory URL, EAB)
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity with the upstream CA
6. Register the upstream account if needed (email + **Register Account**)
7. UCM automatically registers an account on first proxy request if not already done

### Dedicated proxy paths (multi-CA)
Each external CA account can expose its own ACME proxy endpoint:

1. Open **External CA Accounts** (same Let's Encrypt tab)
2. Edit or create a CA account
3. Enable **Expose via ACME proxy**
4. Set a unique **Proxy path (slug)** — e.g. \`actalis-production\`, \`letsencrypt-staging\`
5. Save — the URL appears in the proxy section and on the account card

Clients use:
\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-server:8443/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory
\`\`\`

The legacy default path remains available for the account selected in proxy settings:
\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-server:8443/acme/proxy/directory
\`\`\`

Reserved slugs (cannot be used): \`directory\`, \`new-order\`, \`challenge\`, \`acct\`, etc.

### Account Management
- The **account status badge** shows whether UCM is registered with the upstream CA
- Switching upstream CA automatically clears stale credentials and forces re-registration
- Use the **Reset Account** button to manually clear credentials if needed
- **Test Connection** checks if the upstream directory is reachable and whether EAB is required

### Prune Replaced Certificates
Each proxy renewal imports a fresh certificate into the inventory, so replaced ones pile up over time. The **Purge replaced certificates** toggle (proxy settings) cleans up automatically: when a proxy order finalizes, certificates previously imported by proxy orders for the **exact same domain set** are deleted.

- **Revoked certificates are always kept** — the revocation record stays intact
- Certificates not issued through the proxy are never touched
- Off by default

### Using the Proxy
Point your internal ACME clients to the proxy directory for the target CA.

**Per-CA slug URL** (recommended when several CAs are exposed):
\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-server:8443/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory
\`\`\`

**Default URL** (uses the account selected in proxy settings):
\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-server:8443/acme/proxy/directory
\`\`\`

Example with certbot (replace \`<slug>\` with your CA slug):
\`\`\`
certbot certonly \\
  --server https://your-ucm-server:8443/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory \\
  --preferred-challenges dns-01 \\
  --authenticator manual \\
  --manual-auth-hook /bin/true \\
  --manual-cleanup-hook /bin/true \\
  --non-interactive --agree-tos -m you@example.com \\
  -d subdomain.example.com
\`\`\`

> 💡 Proxy EAB credentials are separate from client EAB — they authenticate UCM with the upstream CA, not your clients with UCM.

> ⚠ Prerequisite: the domain (or a parent domain covering subdomains) must be configured in ACME Domains with a DNS provider. The proxy supports dns-01 only.

> ⚠ Avoid concurrent requests for the same FQDN (Certbot + UCM UI): the second TXT record may overwrite the first.

> ℹ️ In lab/self-signed deployments, add \`--no-verify-ssl\` to Certbot.

## Local ACME Server

### Configuration
- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle the built-in ACME server
- **Default CA** — Select which CA signs certificates by default
- **Terms of Service** — Optional ToS URL for clients

### ACME Directory URL
\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/acme/directory
\`\`\`

Clients like certbot, acme.sh, or Caddy use this URL to discover the ACME endpoints.

### Local Domains (Multi-CA)
Map internal domains to specific CAs. This allows different domains to be signed by different CAs.

1. Click **Add Domain**
2. Enter the domain (e.g., \`internal.corp\` or \`*.dev.local\`)
3. Select the **Issuing CA**
4. Enable/disable **Auto-Approve**
5. Click **Save**

### CA Resolution Order
When an ACME client requests a certificate, UCM determines the signing CA in this order:
1. **Local Domain mapping** — Exact match, then parent domain match
2. **DNS Domain mapping** — The CA configured for the DNS provider
3. **Global default** — The CA set in ACME server configuration
4. **First available** — Any CA with a private key

### EAB Credentials (Server-side)
When UCM is the ACME server (or proxy), you can require **External Account Binding**: clients must present a pre-issued kid + HMAC key to register an account. Issue and revoke credentials from **ACME → EAB Credentials**.

Each credential can be restricted to the **domains it may request certificates for**:
- \`*\` — any domain (the default for new and pre-existing credentials)
- \`*.example.com\` — the domain and all its sub-domains
- An explicit list of domains
- An **empty list blocks issuance entirely** for that credential

Restrictions are enforced on new-order and new-authz, on both the built-in ACME server and the proxy. They are only meaningful when **EAB is required** — otherwise clients can simply register without a credential.

### Accounts
View registered ACME client accounts:
- Account ID and contact email
- Registration date
- Number of orders

### History
Browse all certificate issuance orders:
- Order status (pending, valid, invalid, ready)
- Domain names requested
- Signing CA used
- Issuance timestamp

## IP Address Certificates (RFC 8738)

The local ACME server can issue certificates for **IP addresses** (IPv4 and IPv6), not only DNS names. This is useful for internal services, appliances, and hosts addressed directly by IP.

### Ordering an IP certificate
Use the \`ip\` identifier type in the ACME order:
\`\`\`json
{
  "identifiers": [
    { "type": "ip", "value": "192.0.2.10" },
    { "type": "ip", "value": "2001:db8::1" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`
Mixed DNS + IP orders are also supported.

### Validation
- **HTTP-01** and **TLS-ALPN-01** are the only challenges offered for IP identifiers. **DNS-01 is forbidden** for IPs by RFC 8738.
- **HTTP-01** connects directly to the IP (IPv6 literals are bracketed, e.g. \`http://[2001:db8::1]/...\`).
- **TLS-ALPN-01** uses the reverse-DNS form of the IP (\`in-addr.arpa\` / \`ip6.arpa\`) as the SNI hostname.

### Issued certificate
The signed certificate contains an **iPAddress** SubjectAltName entry for each validated IP.

> 💡 Internal addresses (RFC1918, loopback) validate out of the box — UCM's primary deployment model. Cloud-metadata IPs remain blocked.

## Persistent DNS Validation (dns-persist-01)

The local ACME server supports **dns-persist-01** (draft-ietf-acme-dns-persist): validation through a **persistent** TXT record bound to the ACME account — renewals need no DNS writes.

### Setup
1. Enable it under **ACME → Configuration → Persistent DNS Validation** (off by default).
2. Create the record once:
\`\`\`
_validation-persist.app.example.com. IN TXT "ca.example.com; accounturi=https://ca.example.com/acme/acct/<id>"
\`\`\`
The challenge object advertises the expected \`accounturi\` and \`issuer-domain-names\`.

### Options
- \`policy=wildcard\` — also authorizes wildcard certificates and subdomains of the validated name (a record on a parent domain covers its children)
- \`persistUntil=<unix-timestamp>\` — stops new validation attempts after that time

> ⚠️ The record grants issuance capability to the ACME account key for as long as it exists — delete the TXT record to revoke it.

## Using certbot

\`\`\`
# Register account (Let's Encrypt — default)
certbot register --agree-tos --email admin@example.com

# Register with custom ACME CA + EAB
certbot register \\
  --server 'https://acme.zerossl.com/v2/DV90' \\
  --eab-kid 'your-key-id' \\
  --eab-hmac-key 'your-hmac-key' \\
  --agree-tos --email admin@example.com

# Request certificate with ECDSA key
certbot certonly --server https://your-server:8443/acme/directory \\
  --standalone -d myserver.internal.corp \\
  --key-type ecdsa --elliptic-curve secp256r1

# Renew
certbot renew --server https://your-server:8443/acme/directory
\`\`\`

## Using acme.sh

\`\`\`
# Default (Let's Encrypt)
acme.sh --issue -d example.com --standalone

# Custom ACME CA with EAB and ECDSA
acme.sh --issue \\
  --server 'https://acme-v02.harica.gr/acme/TOKEN/directory' \\
  --eab-kid 'your-key-id' \\
  --eab-hmac-key 'your-hmac-key' \\
  --keylength ec-256 \\
  -d example.com --standalone
\`\`\`

> ⚠ For internal ACME, clients must trust the UCM CA. Install the Root CA certificate in the client's trust store.

## Renewal Information (ARI, RFC 9773)

The local ACME server advertises \`renewalInfo\` in its directory and serves a per-certificate **suggested renewal window**.

- Window centered before expiry → renewals spread over time
- Revoked certificate → window in the past (renew now)
- Unauthenticated GET on \`/acme/renewalInfo/<certID>\`

  est: {
    title: 'EST Protocol',
    content: `
## Overview

Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is defined in **RFC 7030** and provides certificate enrollment, re-enrollment, and CA certificate retrieval over HTTPS. EST is the modern replacement for SCEP, offering stronger security through mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

## Configuration

### Settings Tab

1. **Enable EST** — Toggle the EST protocol on or off
2. **Signing CA** — Select which Certificate Authority signs EST-enrolled certificates
3. **Authentication** — Configure HTTP Basic Auth credentials (username and password)
4. **Certificate Validity** — Default validity period for EST-issued certificates (in days)

### Saving Configuration

Click **Save** to apply changes. The EST endpoints become available immediately when enabled.

## Authentication

EST supports two authentication methods:

### Mutual TLS (mTLS) — Recommended

The client presents a certificate during the TLS handshake. UCM validates the certificate and authenticates the client automatically.

- **Strongest method** — cryptographic client identity
- **Required for** \`/simplereenroll\` — the client must present its current certificate
- **Depends on** proper TLS termination config (reverse proxy must pass \`SSL_CLIENT_CERT\` to UCM)

### HTTP Basic Auth — Fallback

Username and password authentication over HTTPS. Configured in EST Settings.

- **Simpler to set up** — no client certificate needed
- **Less secure** — credentials transmitted per request (protected by HTTPS)
- **Use when** mTLS infrastructure is not available

## EST Endpoints

All endpoints are under \`/.well-known/est/\`:

### GET /cacerts
Retrieve the CA certificate chain. **No authentication required.**

Use this to bootstrap trust — clients fetch the CA cert before enrollment.

\`\`\`bash
curl -k https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est/cacerts | \\
  base64 -d | openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -print_certs
\`\`\`

### POST /simpleenroll
Submit a PKCS#10 CSR and receive a signed certificate.

Requires authentication (mTLS or Basic Auth).

\`\`\`bash
# Using curl with Basic Auth
curl -k --user est-user:est-password \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/pkcs10" \\
  --data-binary @csr.pem \\
  https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est/simpleenroll
\`\`\`

### POST /simplereenroll
Renew an existing certificate. **Requires mTLS** — the client must present the certificate being renewed.

\`\`\`bash
curl -k --cert client.pem --key client.key \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/pkcs10" \\
  --data-binary @csr.pem \\
  https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est/simplereenroll
\`\`\`

### GET /csrattrs
Get the CSR attributes (OIDs) recommended by the server.

### POST /serverkeygen
Server generates a key pair and returns the certificate along with the private key. Useful when the client cannot generate keys locally.

## Information Tab

The Information tab displays:
- **Endpoint URLs** — Copy-paste ready URLs for each EST operation
- **Enrollment Statistics** — Number of enrollments, re-enrollments, and errors
- **Last activity** — Most recent EST operations from audit logs

## Integration Examples

### Using est client (libest)
\`\`\`bash
estclient -s your-server -p 8443 \\
  --srp-user est-user --srp-password est-password \\
  -o /tmp/certs --enroll
\`\`\`

### Using OpenSSL
\`\`\`bash
# Fetch CA certs
curl -k https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est/cacerts | \\
  base64 -d > cacerts.p7

# Generate CSR
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \\
  -keyout client.key -out client.csr \\
  -subj "/CN=my-device/O=MyOrg"

# Enroll (Basic Auth)
curl -k --user est-user:est-password \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/pkcs10" \\
  --data-binary @<(openssl req -in client.csr -outform DER | base64) \\
  https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est/simpleenroll | \\
  base64 -d | openssl x509 -inform DER -out client.pem
\`\`\`

### Windows (certutil)
\`\`\`cmd
certutil -enrollmentServerURL add \\
  "https://your-server:8443/.well-known/est" \\
  kerberos
\`\`\`

## EST vs SCEP

| Feature | EST | SCEP |
|---------|-----|------|
| Transport | HTTPS (TLS) | HTTP or HTTPS |
| Authentication | mTLS + Basic Auth | Challenge password |
| Standard | RFC 7030 (2013) | RFC 8894 (2020, but legacy) |
| Key generation | Server-side option | Client-only |
| Renewal | mTLS re-enrollment | Re-enrollment |
| Security | Strong (TLS-based) | Weaker (shared secret) |
| Recommendation | ✅ Preferred for new | Legacy devices only |

> 💡 Use EST for new deployments. Use SCEP only for legacy network devices that don't support EST.

  tsa: {
    title: 'TSA Protocol',
    content: `
## Overview

Time Stamp Authority (TSA) implements **RFC 3161** to provide trusted timestamps that cryptographically prove a document, hash, or digital signature existed at a specific point in time. TSA is widely used for code signing, legal compliance, long-term archival, and audit trails.

## How It Works

1. **Client creates a timestamp request** — hashes a file with SHA-256/SHA-512 and creates a \`TimeStampReq\` (ASN.1 DER-encoded)
2. **Client sends request to TSA** — HTTP POST to the \`/tsa\` endpoint with \`Content-Type: application/timestamp-query\`
3. **UCM signs the timestamp** — the configured CA signs the hash + current time into a \`TimeStampResp\`
4. **Client receives and stores the response** — the \`.tsr\` file can later prove the document existed at that time

## Configuration

### Settings Tab

1. **Enable TSA** — Toggle the TSA server on or off
2. **Signing CA** — Select which Certificate Authority signs timestamp tokens
3. **Policy OID** — Object Identifier for the TSA policy (e.g., \`1.2.3.4.1\`), included in every timestamp response
4. **Require a dedicated TSA certificate** — Opt-in: refuse to sign timestamps with the CA certificate itself. When enabled, a dedicated end-entity signing certificate with a **critical timeStamping EKU** (RFC 3161) is required

### Choosing a Signing CA

The signing CA's private key is used to sign every timestamp token. Best practices:

- Use a **dedicated sub-CA** for timestamping rather than your root CA
- The CA certificate should include the **id-kp-timeStamping** Extended Key Usage (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8)
- Ensure the CA certificate has **sufficient validity** — timestamps must remain verifiable for years
- Enable **Require a dedicated timestamping certificate** to enforce this at signing time instead of relying on convention

### Policy OID

The Policy OID identifies the TSA policy under which timestamps are issued. It is embedded in every \`TimeStampResp\`.

- Default: \`1.2.3.4.1\` (placeholder)
- For production, register an OID under your organization's arc or use one from your CP/CPS

## Information Tab

The Information tab displays:

- **TSA Endpoint URL** — Copy-paste ready URL for client configuration
- **Usage Examples** — OpenSSL commands for creating requests, sending them, and verifying responses
- **Statistics** — Total timestamp requests processed (successful and failed)

## Usage Examples

### Create a Timestamp Request

\`\`\`bash
# Hash a file and create a timestamp request
openssl ts -query -data file.txt -sha256 -no_nonce -out request.tsq
\`\`\`

### Send Request to TSA

\`\`\`bash
# Send the request and receive a timestamp response
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/timestamp-query" \\
  --data-binary @request.tsq \\
  https://your-server:8443/tsa -o response.tsr
\`\`\`

### Verify a Timestamp

\`\`\`bash
# Verify the timestamp response against the original file
openssl ts -verify -data file.txt -in response.tsr \\
  -CAfile ca-chain.pem
\`\`\`

### Code Signing with Timestamps

When signing code, add the TSA URL to ensure signatures remain valid after certificate expiry:

\`\`\`bash
# Sign with timestamp (osslsigncode)
osslsigncode sign -certs cert.pem -key key.pem \\
  -ts https://your-server:8443/tsa \\
  -in app.exe -out app-signed.exe

# Sign with timestamp (signtool.exe on Windows)
signtool sign /fd SHA256 /tr https://your-server:8443/tsa \\
  /td SHA256 /f cert.pfx app.exe
\`\`\`

### PDF Document Timestamps

\`\`\`bash
# Create a detached timestamp for a PDF
openssl ts -query -data document.pdf -sha256 -cert \\
  -out document.tsq

curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/timestamp-query" \\
  --data-binary @document.tsq \\
  https://your-server:8443/tsa -o document.tsr
\`\`\`

## Protocol Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| RFC | 3161 (Internet X.509 PKI TSP) |
| Endpoint | \`/tsa\` (POST) |
| Content-Type | \`application/timestamp-query\` |
| Response Type | \`application/timestamp-reply\` |
| Hash Algorithms | SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-1 (legacy) |
| Authentication | None (public endpoint) |
| Transport | HTTP or HTTPS |

## Security Considerations

- The TSA endpoint is **public** — no authentication is required (same as CRL/OCSP)
- Each timestamp response is **signed** by the CA key — clients verify the signature to ensure authenticity
- Use **SHA-256 or stronger** hash algorithms when creating requests (SHA-1 is accepted but discouraged)
- The TSA does **not** see the original document — only the hash is transmitted
- Consider **rate limiting** if the TSA endpoint is exposed to the internet

> 💡 Timestamps are essential for code signing: they ensure your signed software remains trusted even after the signing certificate expires.

  // ===================================================================
  truststore: {
    title: 'Trust Store',
    content: `
## Overview

The Trust Store manages trusted CA certificates used for chain validation. Import root and intermediate CAs from external sources or synchronize with the operating system's trust store.

## Certificate Categories

- **Root CA** — Self-signed trust anchors
- **Intermediate** — CAs signed by root or other intermediates
- **Client Auth** — Certificates for mTLS client authentication
- **Code Signing** — Certificates for code signature verification
- **Custom** — Manually categorized certificates

## Importing Certificates

### From File
Upload certificate files in these formats:
- **PEM** — Base64-encoded (single or bundled)
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#7 (P7B)** — Certificate chain

### From URL
Fetch a certificate from a remote HTTPS endpoint. UCM downloads and imports the server's certificate chain.

### Paste PEM
Paste PEM-encoded certificate text directly into the text area.

### Sync from System
Import all trusted CAs from the operating system's trust store. This populates UCM with the same root CAs trusted by the OS (e.g., Mozilla's CA bundle on Linux).

> 💡 Sync from System is a one-time import. Changes to the OS trust store are not automatically reflected.

## Managing Entries

- **Filter by purpose** — Narrow the list by certificate category
- **Search** — Find certificates by subject name
- **Export** — Download individual certificates in PEM format
- **Delete** — Remove a certificate from the trust store

## Use Cases

### Chain Validation
When verifying a certificate chain, UCM checks the trust store for recognized root CAs.

### mTLS
Client certificates presented during mutual TLS authentication are validated against the trust store.

### ACME
When UCM acts as an ACME client (Let's Encrypt), the trust store is used to verify the ACME CA's certificate.

Toggle a user's status without deleting their account.

### Password Reset
Admins can reset any user's password. The user will be prompted to change it on next login.

### API Keys
Each user can have multiple API keys for programmatic access. API keys inherit the user's role permissions. See the Account page for managing your own keys.

## Groups Tab

### Creating a Group
1. Click **Create Group**
2. Enter a **name** and optional description
3. Select the **permissions** the group grants (members receive them on top of their own role)
4. Click **Create**

### Managing Members
- Click a group to see its members
- Use the **transfer panel** to add/remove users
- Users can belong to multiple groups

### Group Permissions
A user's effective permissions are the **union** of:
- Their directly assigned role's permissions
- The permissions granted by every group they belong to

## Roles

### System Roles
- **Admin** — Full access to all features
- **Operator** — Can manage certificates, CAs, CSRs but not system settings
- **Auditor** — Read-only access to all operational data for compliance and audit
- **Viewer** — Read-only access to certificates, CAs, and templates

### Custom Roles
Create roles with granular permissions on the **RBAC** page.

> 💡 Use groups to manage team permissions rather than assigning roles to individual users.

## Authentication Source

The **Source** column shows where each user comes from:
- **Local** — created and managed in UCM (local password)
- **LDAP / OAuth2 / SAML** — auto-provisioned on first SSO login. The originating provider name is shown on the badge (e.g. \`LDAP · Corporate AD\`).

Since v2.133, roles changed manually in UCM for SSO users are **preserved** between logins, unless **"Sync role on every login"** is enabled on the provider (see **Settings → SSO**).

## Overview

RBAC provides fine-grained permission management. Define custom roles with specific permissions and assign them to users or groups.

## System Roles

Four built-in roles that cannot be modified or deleted:

- **Admin** — Full access to everything
- **Operator** — Manage certificates, CAs, CSRs, templates. No access to system settings, users, or RBAC
- **Auditor** — Read-only access to all operational data (certificates, CAs, ACME, SCEP, HSM, audit logs, policies, groups) but not settings or user management
- **Viewer** — Basic read-only access to certificates, CAs, CSRs, templates, and trust store

## Custom Roles

### Creating a Custom Role
1. Click **Create Role**
2. Enter a **name** and optional description
3. Configure permissions using the **permission matrix**
4. Click **Create**

### Permission Matrix
Permissions are organized by category:
- **CAs** — Create, read, update, delete, import, export
- **Certificates** — Issue, read, revoke, renew, delete, export (certificate only — see Private Keys)
- **Private Keys** — Direct private-key export (\`read:private_keys\`), admin-only: no built-in role except Admin holds it. Roles without it go through Key Recovery
- **CSRs** — Create, read, sign, delete
- **Templates** — Create, read, update, delete
- **Users** — Create, read, update, delete
- **Groups** — Create, read, update, delete
- **Settings** — Read, update
- **Audit** — Read, export, cleanup
- **ACME** — Configure, manage accounts
- **SCEP** — Configure, approve requests
- **Trust Store** — Manage trusted certificates
- **HSM** — Manage providers and keys
- **SSH** — Manage SSH CAs and certificates
- **Policies** — View certificate policies
- **Approvals** — View and decide approval requests
- **Key Recovery** — Request recoveries and view requests (approval is admin-only)
- **Backup** — Create, restore

### Category Toggles
Click a category header to enable/disable all permissions in that category at once.

### Coverage Indicator
A percentage badge shows how much of the total permission set the role covers. 100% = Admin equivalent.

## Assigning Roles

Roles are assigned:
- **Directly** — On the Users page, edit a user and select a role
- **Via Groups** — A group grants a permission set; every member receives it in addition to their own role

## Effective Permissions

A user's effective permissions are computed as the union of:
1. Their directly assigned role's permissions
2. The permissions granted by groups they belong to

The most permissive rule wins (additive model, no deny rules).

> ⚠ System roles cannot be edited or deleted. Create custom roles for specific needs.

  auditLogs: {
    title: 'Audit Logs',
    content: `
## Overview

Complete audit trail of all operations in UCM. Every action — certificate issuance, revocation, user login, setting change — is logged with details about who, what, when, and where.

## Log Entry Details

Each log entry records:
- **Timestamp** — When the action occurred
- **User** — Who performed the action
- **Action** — What was done (create, update, delete, login, etc.)
- **Resource** — What was affected (certificate, CA, user, etc.)
- **Status** — Success or failure
- **IP Address** — Source IP of the request
- **User Agent** — Client application identifier
- **Details** — Additional context (error messages, changed values)

## Filtering

### By Action Type
Filter by operation category:
- Certificate operations (issue, revoke, renew, export)
- CA operations (create, import, delete)
- User operations (login, logout, create, update)
- System operations (settings change, backup, restore)

### By User
Show only actions performed by a specific user.

### By Status
- **Success** — Operations that completed successfully
- **Failed** — Operations that failed (authentication failures, permission denied, errors)

### By Date Range
Set **From** and **To** dates to narrow the time window.

### Text Search
Free-text search across all log fields.

## Export

Export filtered logs in:
- **JSON** — Machine-readable, includes all fields
- **CSV** — Spreadsheet-compatible, includes key fields

Exports include only the currently filtered results.

## Cleanup

Purge old logs based on retention period:
1. Click **Cleanup**
2. Set the retention period in days
3. Confirm the cleanup

> ⚠ Log cleanup is irreversible. Export important logs before purging.

## Integrity Verification

Click **Verify Integrity** to check the audit log chain. UCM uses hash chaining to detect if any log entries have been tampered with or deleted.

## Syslog Forwarding

Configure remote syslog forwarding in **Settings → Audit** to send log events to an external SIEM or syslog server in real-time.
`
  },

  // ===================================================================
  settings: {
    title: 'Settings',
    content: `
## Overview

System-wide configuration organized into tabs. Changes take effect immediately unless noted otherwise.

## General

- **Instance Name** — Displayed in the browser title and emails
- **Hostname** — The server's fully qualified domain name
- **Default Validity** — Default certificate validity period in days
- **Expiry Warning Threshold** — Days before expiry to trigger warnings
- **Public ACME vhost** — Concrete hostname in ACME directory URLs (e.g. \`acme.ucm.example.com\` — not \`*.ucm.example.com\`). A wildcard \`*.ucm.example.com\` **TLS certificate SAN** covers both \`admin.ucm.example.com\` and \`acme.ucm.example.com\`. Configure DNS and TLS for the ACME vhost **before** saving — clients that re-read the directory switch URLs immediately.

## Appearance

- **Theme** — Light, Dark, or System (follows OS preference)
- **Accent Color** — Primary color used for buttons, links, and highlights
- **Force Desktop Mode** — Disable responsive mobile layout
- **Sidebar Behavior** — Collapsed or expanded by default

## Email (SMTP)

Configure SMTP for email notifications (expiry alerts, user invitations):
- **SMTP Host** and **Port**
- **Username** and **Password**
- **Encryption** — None, STARTTLS, or SSL/TLS
- **From Address** — Sender email address
- **Content Type** — HTML, Plain Text, or Both
- **Alert Recipients** — Add multiple recipients using the tag input

Click **Test** to send a test email and verify the configuration.

### Email Template Editor

Click **Edit Template** to open the split-pane template editor in a floating window:
- **HTML tab** — Edit the HTML email template with live preview on the right
- **Plain Text tab** — Edit the plain text version for email clients that don't support HTML
- Available variables: \`{{title}}\`, \`{{content}}\`, \`{{datetime}}\`, \`{{instance_url}}\`, \`{{logo}}\`, \`{{title_color}}\`
- Click **Reset to Default** to restore the built-in UCM-branded template
- The window is resizable and draggable for comfortable editing

### Expiry Alerts

When SMTP is configured, enable automatic certificate expiry alerts:
- Toggle alerts on/off
- Select warning thresholds (90d, 60d, 30d, 14d, 7d, 3d, 1d)
- Run **Check Now** to trigger an immediate scan

## Security

### Password Policy
- Minimum length (8-32 characters)
- Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Password expiry (days)
- Password history (prevent reuse)

### Session Management
- Session timeout (minutes of inactivity)
- Maximum concurrent sessions per user

### Rate Limiting
- Login attempt limit per IP
- Lockout duration after exceeding the limit

### IP Restrictions
Allow or deny access from specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges.

### 2FA Enforcement
Require all users to enable two-factor authentication.

### Private Key Encryption
Encrypt all private keys stored in the database with AES-256, protected by a master key file. The section shows the encryption status and the **encrypted / unencrypted** key counters. Two opt-in environment variables make missing keys fatal at startup: \`UCM_REQUIRE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY\` (integration-secret encryption) and \`UCM_REQUIRE_KEY_ENCRYPTION\` (private-key encryption).

> 💡 Security-sensitive settings (session, lockout, HSTS, public URL, password policy) require the **admin:settings** permission — the fields are locked for operators.

> ⚠ Test IP restrictions carefully before applying them. Incorrect rules can lock out all users.

## SSO (Single Sign-On)

### SAML 2.0
- Provide your IDP with the **SP Metadata URL**: \`/api/v2/sso/saml/metadata\`
- Or manually configure: upload/link IDP metadata XML, configure Entity ID and ACS URL
- Map IDP attributes to UCM user fields (username, email, role)

### OAuth2 / OIDC
- Authorization URL and Token URL
- Client ID and Client Secret
- User Info URL (for attribute retrieval)
- Scopes (openid, profile, email)
- Auto-create users on first SSO login

### LDAP
- Server hostname, port (389/636), SSL toggle
- Bind DN and password (service account)
- Base DN and user filter
- Attribute mapping (username, email, full name)

> 💡 Always keep a local admin account as fallback in case SSO breaks.

## Backup

### Manual Backup
Click **Create Backup** to generate a database snapshot. Backups include all certificates, CAs, keys, settings, and audit logs.

### Scheduled Backup
Configure automatic backups:
- Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Retention count (number of backups to keep)

### Restore
Upload a backup file to restore UCM to a previous state.

> ⚠ Restoring a backup replaces ALL current data.

## Audit

- **Log retention** — Auto-cleanup old logs after N days
- **Syslog forwarding** — Send events to a remote syslog server (UDP/TCP/TLS)
- **Integrity verification** — Enable hash chaining for tamper detection

## Database

UCM supports two database backends:

- **SQLite** (default) — file-based, zero-config, ideal for single-node
- **PostgreSQL 13+** — recommended for HA, multi-instance, or when you already operate a managed PG cluster

The active backend is selected by the \`DATABASE_URL\` environment variable. When unset, UCM uses SQLite at \`UCM_DATA_DIR/ucm.db\`.

### Status panel
- Active backend (sqlite / postgresql) and driver
- Database size and table count
- Migration version

### Test connection
Validate a \`DATABASE_URL\` (e.g. \`postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/ucm\`) before switching. The test opens a real connection and reports any error. PostgreSQL servers older than 13 are rejected — UCM requires PostgreSQL 13 or newer.

### Switch backend
Persists \`DATABASE_URL\` to \`/etc/ucm/ucm.env\` (DEB/RPM) and restarts UCM. **No data is copied** — use **Migrate** first if you want to keep your existing data.

### Migrate data
Copies all rows from the current backend to the target. Works in both directions (SQLite ↔ PostgreSQL):

1. The source database is backed up to \`/opt/ucm/data/backups/db_migration/\`
2. The schema is created on the target via SQLAlchemy
3. FK checks are disabled during the bulk load
4. Source/target columns are intersected (legacy columns are skipped with a warning)
5. PostgreSQL sequences are reset after load
6. The service restarts automatically (DEB/RPM) — on Docker, set \`DATABASE_URL\` in your compose file and restart the container manually

**Safety checks (fail fast, source untouched):**
- The target must be empty. If \`users\`, \`cas\`, or \`certificates\` already contain rows, the migration is refused with HTTP 409 and a cleanup hint:
  - PostgreSQL: \`psql ... -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;'\`
  - SQLite: delete the target \`.db\` file
- If the migration fails mid-way, the source is left untouched and the error message points to the source backup. Reset the target before retrying.

> ⚠ Always take a full UCM backup (Settings → Backup) before migrating between backends.

## HTTPS

Manage the TLS certificate used by the UCM web interface:
- View the current certificate details
- Import a new certificate (PEM or PKCS#12)
- Generate a self-signed certificate

> ⚠ Changing the HTTPS certificate requires a service restart.

## Updates

- Check for new UCM versions from GitHub releases
- View the changelog for available updates
- Current version and build information
- **Auto-update**: on supported installations (DEB/RPM), click **Update Now** to download and install the latest version automatically
- **Include pre-releases**: toggle to also check for release candidates (rc)

## Webhooks

Configure HTTP webhooks to notify external systems on events:

### Supported Events
- Certificate issued, revoked, expired, renewed
- CA created, deleted
- User login, logout
- Backup created

### Authentication

Optional outbound authentication (all apply in addition to the optional HMAC signature):

- **None** — No auth header (public webhooks)
- **Bearer** — Authorization: Bearer {token}
- **Basic** — Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
- **API Key** — Custom header (e.g. X-Api-Key: {token})
- **Custom** — Authorization: {scheme} {token} (e.g. auth-key VALUE)

Tokens are stored encrypted and never returned in the UI.

### Creating a Webhook
1. Click **Add Webhook**
2. Enter the **URL** (must be HTTPS)
3. Select the **events** to subscribe to
4. Choose **authentication type** and provide credentials (optional)
5. Optionally set a **secret** for HMAC signature verification
6. Click **Create**

### Testing
Click **Test** to send a sample event to the webhook URL and verify it's reachable.

## Prometheus metrics

Opt-in, token-gated **\`/metrics\`** endpoint.

- Enable it by setting a metrics token (Settings › General); without a token → 404
- Scrape with the \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\` header
- Exposes \`ucm_certificates\`, \`ucm_certificate_authorities\`, \`ucm_scheduler_task_*\`, \`ucm_webhook_deliveries\`, \`ucm_acme_*\`

## Webhook delivery history

Open the history (clock icon) on a webhook to see its deliveries.

- **pending / delivered / failed** statuses with last HTTP code and error
- **Retry** a delivery manually
- Durable queue with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts)

## Scheduler view

Settings › System surfaces the background tasks.

- Task list with **status**, **last run**, **duration** and **failures**
- **Run now** on any task
- Covers expiry, CRL, webhook delivery, backups, auto-renewal…

## Scheduled backups

Settings › Backup enables automatic backups.

- **Daily / weekly / monthly** cadence
- **Retention**: keep the N most recent, prune older ones
- Backups are **encrypted** with the backup password

## Active Directory Connector

UCM's own LDAP connection to Active Directory, independent of any LDAP provider configured under SSO. That one is for logging into UCM; this one is used for certificate-related AD lookups and works whether or not SSO is configured at all.

- **Purpose** — Resolves a Kerberos machine or user principal to its AD object, so UCM can derive a certificate subject/SAN the same way a real Windows CA would
- **Server** — Hostname/IP and port of a domain controller
- **LDAPS** — Toggle to use LDAP over SSL/TLS; **Verify SSL Certificate** validates the DC's certificate (optionally against a custom CA bundle when it isn't publicly trusted)
- **Base DN** and **Bind DN / Password** — Service account credentials used for lookups
- **Test Connection** — Verify connectivity and credentials before saving

### GPO Enrollment Policy URLs

Once configured, register one of the displayed URLs as a Certificate Enrollment Policy server in Group Policy (Public Key Policies → Certificate Services Client – Certificate Enrollment Policy), alongside Certificate Services Client – Auto-Enrollment:
- **Kerberos** — No credential prompt; requires a domain-joined client and the GPO's authentication type set to Kerberos
- **Username/Password** — Prompts for credentials; for interactive "Request New Certificate" enrollment only

## Windows Autoenrollment (XCEP/WSTEP)

Native Windows certificate enrollment via **MS-XCEP** (policy discovery) and **MS-WSTEP** (certificate issuance and renewal) — the same protocols real ADCS uses for MMC "Request New Certificate", \`certreq\`, and unattended GPO autoenrollment.

### Setup Checklist

The tab tracks what's configured versus what's still needed, for both manual and unattended enrollment paths — a Certificate Authority, Policy Discovery (XCEP), Certificate Issuance (WSTEP), and, for unattended GPO autoenrollment, an Active Directory Connector, Kerberos/SPNEGO, and at least one template with autoenrollment allowed.

### Policy Discovery (XCEP)

- **Certificate Authority** — The CA whose templates are advertised and that issues certificates through this configuration
- **Validity (days)** — Default validity applied to certificates issued via WSTEP

### Kerberos / SPNEGO

Binds the Kerberos-authenticated XCEP/WSTEP endpoints used for silent GPO autoenrollment, so machines and users are authenticated by their Kerberos ticket instead of a credential prompt:
- **Service Principal Name (SPN)** — e.g. \`HTTP/ucm.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\`
- **Keytab** — Generated with \`ktpass\` or \`ktutil\` on the domain controller for the SPN above

> ⚠ Kerberos requires the server-side **\`gssapi\` backend** (the Python \`gssapi\` library plus the system Kerberos libraries) — the base SPNEGO package alone is not enough. Without it, Kerberos authentication won't work even when enabled here, and the Kerberos binding is not advertised; a warning is shown on the tab.

### Enrollment Policy URLs

- **Username/Password** — Prompts for credentials; for interactive "Request New Certificate" enrollment, doesn't require Active Directory
- **Kerberos** — No credential prompt; requires a domain-joined client and GPO configuration

### Certificate Renewal Binding

Besides Username/Password and Kerberos, WSTEP supports **client-certificate renewal**, mirroring real ADCS CES endpoints: the renewal request (RST) must be XML-DSig-signed with the private key of a certificate **UCM itself issued**. The presented certificate is matched **byte-for-byte** against the stored certificate for the configured CA — serial number or subject alone are never enough. This lets Windows clients renew unattended using their current certificate, without credentials or a Kerberos ticket.

### SID Security Extension (KB5014754)

On **Kerberos-authenticated issuance**, UCM embeds the requester's AD SID in the Microsoft SID security extension (\`szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT\`) of the issued certificate. Domain controllers use it for **strong certificate mapping** (KB5014754) — required since AD enforcement of strong mapping for certificate-based authentication (smartcard logon, PKINIT).

### AD-Derived Subjects

A certificate template can opt into **Build subject from Active Directory** (Templates → Enrollment): for unattended GPO autoenrollment, the subject and SAN are derived from the requester's AD object via the AD Connector instead of requiring the client to supply one — matching how a real ADCS template is configured for autoenrollment. Independently, **Allow autoenrollment** advertises the template as \`autoEnroll=true\` in Certificate Enrollment Policy so GPO/Kerberos-authenticated clients request it automatically at logon.

  importExport: {
    title: 'Import & Export',
    content: `
## Overview

Import certificates from external sources and export your PKI data for backup or migration.

## Smart Import

The Smart Import wizard auto-detects file types and processes them:

### Supported Formats
- **PEM** — Single or bundled certificates, CAs, and keys
- **DER** — Binary certificate or key
- **PKCS#12 (P12/PFX)** — Certificate + key + chain (requires password)
- **PKCS#7 (P7B)** — Certificate chain without keys

### How It Works
1. Click **Import** or drag files onto the drop zone
2. UCM analyzes each file and identifies its contents
3. Review the detected items (CAs, certificates, keys)
4. Click **Import** to add them to UCM

> 💡 Smart Import handles PEM bundles with multiple certificates in a single file. It automatically distinguishes CAs from end-entity certificates.

## OPNsense Integration

Sync certificates and CAs from an OPNsense firewall:

### Setup
1. In OPNsense, create an API key (System → Access → Users → API Keys)
2. In UCM, enter the OPNsense URL, API key, and API secret
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify

### Import
1. Click **Connect** to fetch available certificates and CAs
2. Select the items you want to import
3. Click **Import Selected**

UCM imports certificates with their private keys (if available) and preserves the CA hierarchy.

## Export Certificates

Bulk export all certificates:
- **PEM** — Individual PEM files
- **P7B Bundle** — All certificates in a single PKCS#7 file
- **ZIP** — All certificates as individual PEM files in a ZIP archive

## Export CAs

Bulk export all Certificate Authorities:
- **PEM** — Certificate chain in PEM format
- **Full chain** — Root → Intermediate → Sub-CA

## Migration Between UCM Instances

To migrate from one UCM instance to another:
1. Create a **backup** on the source (Settings → Backup)
2. Install UCM on the destination
3. **Restore** the backup on the destination

This preserves all data: certificates, CAs, keys, users, settings, and audit logs.

  certTools: {
    title: 'Certificate Tools',
    content: `
## Overview

A toolkit for inspecting, converting, and verifying certificates without leaving UCM.

## SSL Checker

Inspect a remote server's SSL/TLS certificate:

1. Enter the **hostname** (e.g., \`google.com\`)
2. Optionally change the **port** (default: 443)
3. Click **Check**

Results include:
- Certificate subject and issuer
- Validity dates
- SANs (Subject Alternative Names)
- Key type and size
- Full certificate chain
- TLS protocol version

## CSR Decoder

Parse and display CSR contents:

1. Paste a CSR in PEM format
2. Click **Decode**

Shows: Subject, SANs, key algorithm, key size, signature algorithm.

## Certificate Decoder

Parse and display certificate details:

1. Paste a certificate in PEM format
2. Click **Decode**

Shows: Subject, Issuer, SANs, validity, serial number, key usage, extensions, fingerprints.

## Key Matcher

Verify that a certificate, CSR, and private key belong together:

1. Paste the **certificate** PEM
2. Paste the **private key** PEM (optionally encrypted — provide password)
3. Optionally paste a **CSR** PEM
4. Click **Match**

UCM compares the modulus (RSA) or public key (EC) hashes. A match confirms they form a valid pair.

## Converter

Convert between certificate and key formats:

### PEM → DER
Converts a Base64-encoded PEM to binary DER format.

### PEM → PKCS#12
Creates a password-protected P12/PFX file from:
- Certificate PEM
- Private key PEM
- Optional chain certificates
- Password for the P12 file

### PKCS#12 → PEM
Extracts certificate, key, and chain from a P12 file:
- Upload the P12 file
- Enter the password
- Download the extracted PEM components

### PEM → PKCS#7
Bundles multiple certificates into a single P7B file (no keys).

> 💡 The converter preserves the full certificate chain when creating PKCS#12 files.

    title: 'Hardware Security Modules',
    content: `
## Overview

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provide tamper-resistant storage for cryptographic keys. Private keys stored on an HSM never leave the hardware, providing the highest level of key protection.

## Supported Providers

### PKCS#11
The industry standard HSM interface. Supported devices:
- **Thales Luna** / **SafeNet**
- **Entrust nShield**
- **SoftHSM** (software-based, for testing)
- Any PKCS#11-compliant device

> 💡 **Docker**: SoftHSM is pre-installed in the Docker image. On first start, a default token is auto-initialized and registered as the \`SoftHSM-Default\` provider — ready to use immediately.

Configuration:
- **Library Path** — Path to the PKCS#11 shared library (.so/.dll)
- **Slot** — HSM slot number
- **PIN** — User PIN for authentication

### AWS CloudHSM
Amazon Web Services cloud-based HSM:
- **Cluster ID** — CloudHSM cluster identifier
- **Region** — AWS region
- **Credentials** — AWS access key and secret

### Azure Key Vault
Microsoft Azure managed key storage:
- **Vault URL** — Azure Key Vault endpoint
- **Tenant ID** — Azure AD tenant
- **Client ID/Secret** — Service principal credentials

### Google Cloud KMS
Google Cloud Key Management Service:
- **Project** — GCP project ID
- **Location** — KMS key ring location
- **Key Ring** — Name of the key ring
- **Credentials** — Service account JSON key

### OpenBao / Vault Transit
OpenBao or HashiCorp Vault Transit Secrets Engine. Keys are managed remotely via the Transit API — no PKCS#11 library required.

Configuration:
- **URL** — Server address (e.g., \`https://openbao.example.com:8200\`)
- **Token** — Authentication token
- **Mount Path** — Transit engine mount point (default: \`transit\`)
- **Namespace** — Optional namespace for multi-tenant setups
- **TLS Skip Verify** — Skip TLS certificate verification (for self-signed certs)

Supported key types:
- RSA 2048, 3072, 4096
- ECDSA P-256, P-384, P-521
- AES-256-GCM (symmetric)

> 💡 OpenBao is a community-maintained fork of HashiCorp Vault. UCM works with both OpenBao and Vault.

> 💡 For development, run OpenBao in dev mode: \`docker run -d -p 8200:8200 -e BAO_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=test-token quay.io/openbao/openbao:latest server -dev\`

## Managing Providers

### Adding a Provider
1. Click **Add Provider**
2. Select the **provider type**
3. Enter the connection details
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Save**

### Testing Connection
Always test the connection after creating or modifying a provider. UCM verifies it can communicate with the HSM and authenticate.

### Provider Status
Each provider shows a connection status indicator:
- **Connected** — HSM is reachable and authenticated
- **Disconnected** — Cannot reach the HSM
- **Error** — Authentication or configuration issue

## Key Management

### Generating Keys
1. Select a connected provider
2. Click **Generate Key**
3. Choose the algorithm (RSA 2048/4096, ECDSA P-256/P-384)
4. Enter a key label/alias
5. Click **Generate**

The key is created directly on the HSM. UCM stores only a reference.

### Using HSM Keys
When creating a CA, select an HSM provider and key instead of generating a software key. The CA's signing operations are performed on the HSM.

> ⚠ Keys generated on an HSM cannot be exported. If you lose access to the HSM, you lose the keys.

> 💡 Use SoftHSM for development and testing before deploying with physical HSMs.

  sso: {
    title: 'Single Sign-On',
    content: `
## Overview

SSO allows users to authenticate using their organization's Identity Provider (IDP), eliminating the need for separate UCM credentials. UCM supports **SAML 2.0**, **OAuth2/OIDC**, and **LDAP**.

## SAML 2.0

### SP Metadata URL

UCM provides a **Service Provider (SP) Metadata URL** that you can give to your IDP for automatic configuration:

\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-host:8443/api/v2/sso/saml/metadata
\`\`\`

This URL returns a SAML 2.0 compliant XML document containing:
- **Entity ID** — UCM's service provider identifier
- **ACS URL** — Assertion Consumer Service endpoint (HTTP-POST)
- **SLO URL** — Single Logout Service endpoint
- **Signing Certificate** — UCM's HTTPS certificate for signing verification
- **NameID Format** — Requested name identifier format

Copy this URL into your IDP's "Add Service Provider" or "SAML Application" configuration.

> ⚠️ **Important:** UCM's HTTPS certificate must be **trusted by the IDP**. If the IDP cannot validate the certificate (e.g., self-signed or issued by a private CA), it will reject the metadata as invalid. Import UCM's CA certificate into the IDP's trust store, or use a certificate signed by a publicly trusted CA.

### Configuration
1. Obtain the IDP metadata URL or XML file from your identity provider
2. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
3. Click **Add Provider** → SAML
4. Enter the **IDP Metadata URL** — UCM auto-populates Entity ID, SSO/SLO URLs, and certificate
5. Or paste the IDP metadata XML directly
6. Configure **attribute mapping** (username, email, groups)
7. Click **Save** and **Enable**

### Attribute Mapping
Map IDP SAML attributes to UCM user fields:
- \`username\` → UCM username (required)
- \`email\` → UCM email (required)
- \`groups\` → UCM group membership (optional)

## OAuth2 / OIDC

### Configuration
1. Register UCM as a client in your OAuth2/OIDC provider
2. Set the **Redirect URI** to: \`https://your-ucm-host:8443/api/v2/sso/callback/oauth2\`
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
5. Click **Add Provider** → OAuth2
6. Enter the **Authorization URL** and **Token URL**
7. Enter the **User Info URL** (for fetching user attributes after login)
8. Enter Client ID and Secret
9. Configure scopes (openid, profile, email)
10. Click **Save** and **Enable**

### Auto-Create Users
When enabled, a new UCM user account is automatically created on first SSO login, using the IDP-provided attributes. The default role is assigned.

## LDAP

### Configuration
1. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
2. Click **Add Provider** → LDAP
3. Enter the **LDAP Server** hostname and **Port** (389 for LDAP, 636 for LDAPS)
4. Enable **Use SSL** for encrypted connections
5. Enter the **Bind DN** and **Bind Password** (service account credentials)
6. Enter the **Base DN** (search base for user lookups)
7. Configure the **User Filter** (e.g., \`(uid={username})\` or \`(sAMAccountName={username})\` for AD)
8. Map LDAP attributes: **username**, **email**, **full name**
9. Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Save** and **Enable**

### Active Directory
For Microsoft Active Directory, use:
- Port: **389** (or 636 with SSL)
- User Filter: \`(sAMAccountName={username})\`
- Username attr: \`sAMAccountName\`
- Email attr: \`mail\`
- Full name attr: \`displayName\`

## Login Flow
1. User clicks **Login with SSO** on the UCM login page (or enters LDAP credentials)
2. For SAML/OAuth2: user is redirected to the IDP, authenticates, then redirected back
3. For LDAP: credentials are verified directly against the LDAP server
4. UCM creates or updates the user account
5. User is logged in

> ⚠ Always keep at least one local admin account as fallback in case SSO misconfiguration locks everyone out.

> 💡 Test SSO with a non-admin account first before making it the primary authentication method.

> 💡 Use the **Test Connection** button to verify your configuration before enabling a provider.

  security: {
    title: 'Security Settings',
    content: `
## Overview

System-wide security configuration affecting all user accounts and access patterns.

## Private Key Encryption

Encrypt all CA and certificate private keys stored in the database with AES-256, protected by a master key file kept outside the database.

- **Status and counters** — The section shows whether encryption is enabled and how many keys are currently **encrypted** vs **unencrypted**
- **Enable Encryption** — Generates the master key file and encrypts all stored private keys. Back up the key file immediately: without it, encrypted keys are permanently lost
- **Disable Encryption** — Decrypts all private keys back to plaintext storage (confirmation required)

### Startup Enforcement

Without a configured encryption key, UCM logs a warning at startup but keeps running. Two **opt-in environment variables** turn that into a hard failure:

- \`UCM_REQUIRE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY\` — refuse to start without an explicit database encryption key (otherwise integration secrets fall back to a key derived from the machine id)
- \`UCM_REQUIRE_KEY_ENCRYPTION\` — refuse to start unless private-key encryption is enabled

Both accept \`1\`/\`true\`/\`yes\`/\`on\`. An invalid key is treated as fatal instead of silently falling back to plaintext.

## Password Policy

### Complexity Requirements
- **Minimum length** — 8 to 32 characters
- **Require uppercase** — At least one uppercase letter
- **Require lowercase** — At least one lowercase letter
- **Require numbers** — At least one digit
- **Require special characters** — At least one symbol

### Password Expiry
Force users to change their password after a set number of days. Set to 0 to disable.

### Password History
Prevent reuse of the last N passwords. Users cannot set a password matching any of their previous N passwords.

## Session Management

### Session Timeout
Automatically log out users after N minutes of inactivity. Applies to web UI sessions only, not API keys.

### Concurrent Sessions
Limit the number of simultaneous sessions per user. Additional logins will terminate the oldest session.

## Rate Limiting

### Login Attempts
Limit failed login attempts per IP address within a time window. After exceeding the limit, the IP is temporarily blocked.

### Lockout Duration
How long an IP is blocked after exceeding the login attempt limit.

## IP Restrictions

### Allow List
Only allow connections from specified IPs or CIDR ranges. All other IPs are blocked.

### Deny List
Block specific IPs or CIDR ranges. All other IPs are allowed.

> ⚠ Be extremely careful with IP restrictions. Misconfiguration can lock out all users, including admins. Always test with a single IP first.

## Two-Factor Authentication

### Enforcement
Require all users to enable 2FA. Users who haven't set up 2FA will be prompted on their next login.

### Supported Methods
- **TOTP** — Time-based one-time passwords (authenticator apps)
- **WebAuthn** — Hardware security keys and biometrics

> 💡 Enforce 2FA for admin accounts at minimum. Consider enforcing it for all users in security-sensitive environments.

## mTLS Authentication

Let users log in with a client certificate instead of a password:

- **Trusted CA** — Select the CA that issues and validates mTLS client certificates
- **Require client certificate** — Optionally make mTLS mandatory for the web UI
- Changing mTLS settings requires a service restart

## Required Permissions

Security-sensitive settings — session, lockout, HSTS, public URL, and password policy — require the **admin:settings** permission. For operators (write:settings only), those fields are shown locked; the rest of the card still saves normally.

  // ===== GOVERNANCE =====

  policies: {
    title: 'Certificate Policies',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate policies define the rules and constraints enforced when certificates are issued, renewed, or revoked. Policies are evaluated in **priority order** (lower number = higher precedence) and can be scoped to specific CAs.

## Policy Types

### Issuance Policies
Rules applied when new certificates are created. This is the most common type. Controls key types, validity periods, SAN restrictions, and whether approval is required.

### Renewal Policies
Rules applied when certificates are renewed. Can enforce shorter validity on renewal or require re-approval.

### Revocation Policies
Rules applied when certificates are revoked. Can require approval before revocation of critical certificates.

## Rules Configuration

### Max Validity
Maximum certificate lifetime in days. Common values:
- **90 days** — Short-lived automation (ACME-style)
- **397 days** — CA/Browser Forum baseline for public TLS
- **730 days** — Internal/private PKI
- **365 days** — Code signing

### Allowed Key Types
Restrict which key algorithms and sizes can be used:
- **RSA-2048** — Minimum for public trust
- **RSA-4096** — Higher security, larger certificates
- **EC-P256** — Modern, fast, recommended
- **EC-P384** — Higher security elliptic curve
- **EC-P521** — Maximum security (rarely needed)

### SAN Restrictions
- **Max DNS Names** — Limit the number of Subject Alternative Names
- **DNS Pattern** — Restrict to specific domain patterns (e.g. \`*.company.com\`)

## Approval Workflows

When **Require Approval** is enabled, certificate issuance is paused until the required number of approvers from the assigned group have approved the request.

### Configuration
- **Approval Group** — Select a user group responsible for approvals
- **Min Approvers** — Number of approvals required (e.g. 2 of 3 group members)
- **Notifications** — Alert administrators when policies are violated

> 💡 Use approval workflows for high-value certificates like code signing and wildcard certificates.

## Priority System

Policies are evaluated in priority order. Lower numbers have higher precedence:
- **1–10** — Critical security policies (code signing, wildcard)
- **10–20** — Standard compliance (public TLS, internal PKI)
- **20+** — Permissive defaults

When multiple policies match a certificate request, the highest-priority (lowest number) policy wins.

## Scope

### All CAs
Policy applies to every CA in the system. Use for organization-wide rules.

### Specific CA
Policy applies only to certificates issued by the selected CA. Use for granular control.

## Default Policies

UCM ships with 5 built-in policies reflecting real-world PKI best practices:
- **Code Signing** (priority 5) — Strong keys, approval required
- **Wildcard Certificates** (priority 8) — Approval required, max 10 SANs
- **Web Server TLS** (priority 10) — CA/B Forum compliant, 397-day max
- **Short-Lived Automation** (priority 15) — 90-day ACME-style
- **Internal PKI** (priority 20) — 730-day, relaxed rules

> 💡 Customize or disable default policies to match your organization's requirements.
`
  },

  approvals: {
    title: 'Approval Requests',
    content: `
## Overview

The Approvals page shows all certificate requests that require manual approval before issuance. Approval workflows are configured in **Policies** — when a policy has "Require Approval" enabled, any matching certificate request creates an approval request here.

## Request Lifecycle

### Pending
The request is awaiting review. The certificate cannot be issued until the required number of approvers have approved it. Pending requests appear first by default.

### Approved
All required approvals have been received. The certificate will be issued automatically once approved.

### Rejected
Any single rejection immediately stops the request. The certificate will not be issued. A rejection comment is required to explain the reason.

### Expired
The request was not reviewed before the deadline. Expired requests must be re-submitted.

## Approving a Request

1. Click a pending request to view its details
2. Review the certificate details, requester, and associated policy
3. Click **Approve** and optionally add a comment
4. The approval is recorded with your username and timestamp

## Rejecting a Request

1. Click a pending request to view its details
2. Click **Reject**
3. Enter a **rejection reason** (required) — this is logged for audit compliance
4. The request is immediately stopped

> ⚠ Any single rejection stops the entire request. This is intentional — if any reviewer identifies a problem, issuance should not proceed.

## Approval History

Each request maintains a complete approval timeline showing:
- Who approved or rejected (username)
- When the action was taken (timestamp)
- Comment provided (if any)

This history is immutable and part of the audit trail.

## Filtering

Use the status filter bar at the top to show:
- **Pending** — Requests awaiting your review
- **Approved** — Recently approved requests
- **Rejected** — Rejected requests with reasons
- **Total** — All requests regardless of status

## Permissions

- **read:approvals** — View approval requests
- **write:approvals** — Approve or reject requests

> 💡 Set up email notifications in policies so approvers are alerted when new requests arrive.
`
  },

  keyRecovery: {
    title: 'Key Recovery',
    content: `
## Overview

Key Recovery retrieves the **archived private key** of a previously issued certificate through an approval-gated, fully audited workflow. It is meant for keys that were **not exported at issuance time** — the preset did not allow export, or it was simply skipped — and are needed later, with an approval trail attached to the retrieval.

Recovery only works when the private key was archived (stored in the database) at issuance. It cannot reconstruct a key that was never kept.

## Workflow

### 1. Request
A user opens a recovery request for a specific certificate and provides a reason. The request is recorded and enters the pending state.

### 2. Approve (four-eyes)
A second authorised operator reviews the request and approves it. The requester **cannot approve their own request** — request and approval are separate actions by different people (dual control).

### 3. Download
Once approved, the archived key is released as a **password-protected PKCS#12** bundle. The download is recorded in the audit trail.

## Requirements

- **Archived key** — the certificate's private key must be present in the database. Certificates whose key was never archived cannot be recovered.
- **Dual control** — the request and the approval are distinct steps performed by different users.

## Permissions

- **read:key_recovery** — Request a recovery and view requests
- **admin** — Approve or deny a pending recovery request
- **read:private_keys** — Admin-only scope required for *direct* private-key export from the Certificates page (bypassing this workflow)

## What it is (and isn't)

Key Recovery adds an **approval trail** to retrieving an archived key after issuance. Direct private-key export is gated behind the admin-only **read:private_keys** scope — roles without it (including the built-in Operator role) must go through Key Recovery, so the four-eyes approval cannot be bypassed.

> 💡 Every request, approval and download is written to the audit trail for compliance.

  discovery: {
    title: 'Certificate Discovery',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate Discovery scans your network to find TLS certificates deployed on servers and endpoints, and matches them against your managed PKI inventory. Use it to locate untracked certificates, detect changes, and watch for expiring certificates outside UCM's control.

## Tabs

### Discovered
All certificates found by scans, with status, expiry, and endpoint details. Click a row to open the detail panel with certificate info, Subject Alternative Names, and scan history (first seen, last seen, last changed).

### Profiles
Saved scan configurations for recurring scans — targets, ports, schedule, and notifications.

### History
Past scan runs with duration, targets scanned, certificates found, and who triggered the run.

## Quick Scan

Run an ad-hoc scan without saving a profile:

1. Click **Quick Scan**
2. Enter **targets** — one per line: hostname, IP, CIDR subnet (\`192.168.1.0/24\`), or \`host:port\` (\`10.0.0.1:8443\`)
3. Enter **ports** — comma-separated TCP ports (e.g. \`443, 8443, 636\`), or pick the common-ports preset
4. Optionally tune **advanced options** — reverse DNS resolution (PTR records), timeout, concurrency
5. Click **Start Scan** — progress updates live via WebSocket

## Scan Profiles

Profiles save a target configuration for repeated use:

- **Targets and ports** — same formats as Quick Scan
- **Schedule** — manual, or automatic every 1h / 6h / 12h / 24h / 7d
- **Notifications** — email alerts when new certificates are discovered, when a certificate changes on an endpoint, or when discovered certificates are expiring

Run a profile on demand with **Scan**, or let the scheduler run it at the configured interval.

## Result Statuses

- **Managed** — The certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint matches a certificate in UCM's inventory
- **Unmanaged** — Found on the network but not in the inventory — a candidate for bringing under management
- **Error** — The endpoint could not be scanned; the error column shows a hint (connection refused, DNS failure, timeout, TLS handshake / SNI issue)

### Change Detection
When an endpoint presents a different certificate than the previous scan, the change is recorded (previous fingerprint kept, **Last changed** timestamp) and can trigger a notification.

## Filtering & Export

- **Status filter pills** — Managed, Unmanaged, Error, Expired, Expiring Soon
- **Profile filter** — Restrict results to one scan profile
- **Export** — Download discovered certificates as CSV or JSON (filters apply)
- **Retry** — Re-scan individual error targets, or **Retry all errors** at once
- **Resolve DNS** — Bulk reverse-DNS resolution for discovered IPs

## Limits & Security

- Subnets are capped at 1024 addresses (a /22 IPv4 equivalent); up to 1000 targets per profile scan
- Private RFC1918 ranges and loopback are scannable — UCM's on-prem deployment model; link-local, multicast, and reserved ranges are blocked
- All scan actions are audit-logged

## Permissions

- **read:certificates** — View discovered certificates, profiles, and history
- **admin:system** — Create/edit profiles and run scans
- **delete:certificates** — Delete discovered results

> 💡 Schedule a daily scan of your server subnets and enable the new-certificate notification — it catches certificates deployed outside your PKI process.

  // ===================================================================
  msca: {
    title: 'Microsoft AD CS Integration',
    content: `
## Overview

UCM integrates with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to sign CSRs using your existing Windows PKI infrastructure. This bridges your internal CA with UCM's certificate lifecycle management.

## Setting Up a Connection

1. Go to **Settings → Microsoft CA**
2. Click **Add Connection**
3. Enter the **Connection Name** and **CA Server Hostname**
4. Optionally enter the **CA Common Name** (auto-detected if empty)
5. Select the **Authentication Method**
6. Enter the credentials for your chosen method
7. Click **Test Connection** to verify
8. Set a **Default Template** and click **Save**

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Requirements | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Client Certificate (mTLS)** | Client cert/key PEM from the CA | Production — no domain join needed |
| **Basic Auth** | Username + password, HTTPS | Simple setups — enable basic auth in IIS certsrv |
| **Kerberos** | Domain-joined machine + keytab | Enterprise AD environments |

### Client Certificate Setup (Recommended)

1. On your Windows CA, create a certificate for the UCM service account
2. Export as PFX, then convert to PEM:
   \`\`\`bash
   openssl pkcs12 -in client.pfx -out client-cert.pem -clcerts -nokeys
   openssl pkcs12 -in client.pfx -out client-key.pem -nocerts -nodes
   \`\`\`
3. Paste the cert and key PEM content into the UCM connection form

## Signing CSRs via Microsoft CA

1. Navigate to **CSRs → Pending**
2. Select a CSR and click **Sign**
3. Switch to the **Microsoft CA** tab
4. Select the connection and certificate template
5. Click **Sign**

### Auto-Approved Templates
The certificate is returned immediately and imported into UCM.

### Manager Approval Templates
UCM saves the request as **Pending** and tracks the MS CA request ID. Once approved on the Windows CA, check the status from the CSR detail panel to import the certificate.

## Enroll on Behalf Of (EOBO)

EOBO allows an enrollment agent to request certificates on behalf of other users. This is common in enterprise environments where a PKI administrator manages certificates for end users.

### Prerequisites

- The UCM service account needs an **enrollment agent certificate** issued by the CA
- The certificate template must have **"Enroll on behalf of other users"** permission enabled
- The template's security tab must grant the enrollment agent the right to enroll

### Using EOBO in UCM

1. In the sign modal, select the Microsoft CA connection and template
2. Check the **Enroll on Behalf Of (EOBO)** checkbox
3. The fields auto-populate from the CSR:
   - **Enrollee DN** — from the CSR subject (e.g., CN=John Doe,OU=Users,DC=corp,DC=local)
   - **Enrollee UPN** — from the CSR SAN email (e.g., john.doe@corp.local)
4. Adjust the values if needed
5. Click **Sign**

UCM passes these as ADCS request attributes:
- EnrolleeObjectName:<DN> — identifies the target user in AD
- EnrolleePrincipalName:<UPN> — the user's login name

### EOBO vs Direct Enrollment

| Feature | Direct Enrollment | EOBO |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Who signs | User themselves | Enrollment agent on behalf |
| Private key | User's machine | Can be on UCM (CSR model) |
| Template permission | Standard enroll | Requires enrollment agent rights |
| Use case | Self-service | Centralized PKI management |

## Certificate Lifecycle

### Renewing an AD CS certificate
Renewal does **not** re-sign locally (the issuing key lives on the Windows CA). UCM resubmits the certificate's original CSR — same key, subject and SANs — to the connection and template that issued it, and updates the certificate in place. If the CA holds the renewal for manager approval, it is tracked as a pending request.

### Revoking an AD CS certificate
AD CS Web Enrollment has no revocation endpoint. Revoking an AD CS-issued certificate:
- **Without the WinRM admin channel** — marks it revoked in UCM only; the Windows CA is not notified. Revoke it on the CA as well.
- **With the WinRM admin channel** — UCM propagates the revocation to the Windows CA (certutil -revoke + CRL publish). Lifting a certificateHold propagates the unrevoke too.

## WinRM Admin Channel (optional)

The admin channel lets UCM run management operations on the Windows CA that Web Enrollment cannot: revoke/unrevoke, publish CRL, inventory, and approve/deny pending requests. It uses PowerShell remoting + certutil.

### Requirements
- **WinRM enabled** on the CA (Enable-PSRemoting; HTTPS listener on 5986 recommended)
- The optional **pywinrm** package installed in UCM (pip install pywinrm)
- An account allowed to **manage certificates** on the CA ("Issue and Manage Certificates")

### Configuration
1. Edit the connection and enable **WinRM admin channel**
2. Set the host (defaults to the connection server), port, and transport
3. **Transport**: Kerberos (recommended, reuses the connection keytab) or NTLM, over HTTP or HTTPS
4. **Credentials**: leave empty to reuse the connection's own (Basic/Kerberos). mTLS connections have no reusable WinRM credential — set a dedicated account
5. Click **Test admin channel**

| Enroll auth mode | Reuses credentials for WinRM? |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Kerberos (keytab) | Yes — same principal/keytab |
| Basic (user/pass) | Yes — password to NTLM/Kerberos |
| Certificate (mTLS) | No — set a dedicated WinRM account |

## CRL Revocation Sync

Enable **Sync revocations from the CA's CRL** on the connection so UCM periodically fetches the CA's CRL and marks certificates revoked on the CA as revoked in UCM. This is strictly one-way (CA to UCM) and never un-revokes a certificate revoked in UCM. The CRL URL is taken from the connection or auto-detected from issued certificates' CRL Distribution Point, and its signature is verified against the CA certificate before anything is applied. Runs hourly, plus a **Sync CRL now** action.

## CA Inventory Sync

Enable **Import certificates issued directly on the CA** to bring certificates issued outside UCM (native tools, autoenrollment, or before UCM existed) into UCM's store, so UCM tracks the whole lifecycle. It reads the CA database with certutil -view, imports certificates UCM doesn't already have (deduplicated by serial), and is incremental by request id (with a full-rescan option). A **reconciliation** view lists certificates present on the CA but not in UCM, and vice versa. Runs every 6 hours plus an **Import from CA now** action. Requires the WinRM admin channel.

## CA Control Panel

The control panel (opened from the connection, requires the admin channel) manages requests awaiting CA manager approval and shows CA health:
- **Pending requests** — list, **Approve** (certutil -resubmit; the issued certificate is imported automatically) or **Deny** (certutil -deny)
- **Health** — CA service status, CA certificate expiry, CRL next-update, and pending-request count

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify hostname, port 443, and that certsrv is accessible |
| No templates found | Check that the UCM account has enrollment permissions on the CA |
| EOBO denied | Verify enrollment agent certificate and template permissions |
| Request stuck pending | Approve it from the CA Control Panel, or on the Windows CA console then refresh status |
| Admin channel test fails | Verify WinRM is enabled on the CA, the port/transport, and that pywinrm is installed |
| Revocation not on the CA | Enable the WinRM admin channel — without it, revocation is local to UCM |
| Pending not detected (non-English CA) | Fixed in v2.192 — UCM now recognizes localized AD CS pending pages |

> 💡 Use the **Test Connection** button to verify authentication and discover available templates before signing. Enable the **WinRM admin channel** to manage revocation, CRLs, inventory and pending requests directly from UCM.

    title: 'SSH Certificate Authorities',
    content: `
## Overview

SSH Certificate Authorities (CAs) are the foundation of SSH certificate-based authentication. Instead of distributing individual public keys to every server, you create a CA and configure servers to trust it. Any certificate signed by the CA is then automatically accepted.

UCM supports the OpenSSH certificate format (RFC 4253 + OpenSSH extensions), which is natively understood by OpenSSH 5.4+ — no additional software needed on servers or clients.

## CA Types

### User CA
A User CA signs certificates that authenticate **users to servers**. When a server trusts a User CA, any user presenting a valid certificate signed by that CA is allowed to log in (subject to principal matching).

**Server configuration:**
\`\`\`
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/user_ca.pub
\`\`\`

### Host CA
A Host CA signs certificates that authenticate **servers to clients**. When a client trusts a Host CA, it can verify that the server it connects to is legitimate — eliminating "trust on first use" (TOFU) warnings.

**Client configuration:**
\`\`\`
# ~/.ssh/known_hosts
@cert-authority *.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
\`\`\`

## Creating a CA

1. Click **Create SSH CA**
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production User CA")
3. Select the CA type: **User** or **Host**
4. Choose the key algorithm:
   - **Ed25519** — Recommended. Fast, small keys, modern security.
   - **ECDSA P-256/P-384** — Good compatibility and security.
   - **RSA 2048/4096** — Broadest compatibility, larger keys.
5. Optionally set max validity and default extensions
6. Click **Create**

### TTL Formats

The **Default TTL** and **Max TTL** fields accept human-readable durations:

- Suffixed values — \`24h\`, \`7d\`, \`365d\` (accepted suffixes: \`s\`, \`m\`, \`h\`, \`d\`, \`w\`, \`y\`)
- Bare numbers — interpreted as **seconds** (e.g. \`3600\` = 1 hour)

Malformed values are rejected with an error naming the accepted formats.

> 💡 Use separate CAs for user and host certificates. Never use one CA for both purposes.

## Server Setup

### Automatic Setup Script

UCM generates a POSIX shell script that automatically configures your server:

1. Open the CA detail panel
2. Click **Download Setup Script**
3. Transfer the script to your server
4. Run it:

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x setup-ssh-ca.sh
sudo ./setup-ssh-ca.sh
\`\`\`

The script:
- Detects your OS and init system
- Backs up sshd_config before any changes
- Installs the CA public key
- Adds TrustedUserCAKeys (user CA) or HostCertificate (host CA)
- Validates the config with \`sshd -t\`
- Restarts sshd only if validation passes
- Supports \`--dry-run\` to preview changes

### Manual Setup

#### User CA
\`\`\`bash
# Copy the CA public key to the server
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... user-ca" | sudo tee /etc/ssh/user_ca.pub

# Add to sshd_config
echo "TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/user_ca.pub" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Restart sshd
sudo systemctl restart sshd
\`\`\`

#### Host CA
\`\`\`bash
# Sign the server's host key
# Then add to sshd_config:
echo "HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
\`\`\`

## Key Revocation Lists (KRL)

SSH CAs support Key Revocation Lists to invalidate compromised certificates:

1. Revoke certificates from the SSH Certificates page
2. Download the updated KRL from the CA detail panel
3. Deploy the KRL file to servers:

\`\`\`bash
# Add to sshd_config
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys
\`\`\`

> ⚠ Servers must be configured to check the KRL. Revocation does not take effect until the KRL is deployed.

## Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Separate CAs | Use distinct CAs for user and host certificates |
| Key algorithm | Ed25519 for new deployments, RSA 4096 for legacy compatibility |
| CA lifetime | Keep CAs long-lived; use short-lived certificates instead |
| Backup | Export and securely store the CA private key |
| Principal mapping | Map principals to specific usernames, not wildcards |

  // ===== SSH CERTIFICATES =====
  sshCertificates: {
    title: 'SSH Certificates',
    content: `
## Overview

SSH certificates are signed SSH public keys with metadata: identity, validity period, permitted principals, and extensions. They replace the traditional \`authorized_keys\` approach with centralized, time-limited, auditable access control.

UCM issues OpenSSH-format certificates compatible with OpenSSH 5.4+ on any platform.

## Issuance Modes

### Sign Mode (Recommended)
The user generates their own key pair and provides only the **public key** to UCM. The private key never leaves the user's machine.

**User workflow:**
\`\`\`bash
# 1. Generate a key pair (user's machine)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_work -C "jdoe@example.com"

# 2. Copy the public key content
cat ~/.ssh/id_work.pub

# 3. Paste into UCM's sign form
# 4. Download the signed certificate
# 5. Save as ~/.ssh/id_work-cert.pub

# 6. Connect
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_work user@server
\`\`\`

### Generate Mode
UCM generates both the key pair and the certificate. Use this when you need to provision credentials centrally.

> ⚠ **Download the private key immediately** — it is not stored in UCM and cannot be recovered.

**Workflow:**
1. Select a CA and fill in the certificate details
2. Choose "Generate" mode
3. Click **Issue**
4. Download all three files:
   - Private key (\`keyid\`) — **Save securely!**
   - Certificate (\`keyid-cert.pub\`)
   - Public key (\`keyid.pub\`)

## Certificate Fields

### Key ID
A unique identifier embedded in the certificate. It appears in SSH server logs when the certificate is used, making it essential for auditing.

**Good key IDs:** \`jdoe-prod-2025\`, \`webserver-01\`, \`deploy-ci-pipeline\`

### Principals
Principals define **who** (user certs) or **what** (host certs) the certificate is valid for:

- **User certificates**: list of usernames the holder can log in as (e.g., \`deploy\`, \`admin\`)
- **Host certificates**: list of hostnames/IPs the server is known by (e.g., \`web01.example.com\`, \`10.0.1.5\`)

> 💡 If no principals are specified, the certificate works for any principal — which is usually too permissive.

### Validity

Choose a preset or set custom duration:

| Preset | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 1 hour | CI/CD pipelines, one-time tasks |
| 8 hours | Standard workday access |
| 24 hours | Extended access |
| 7 days | Sprint-based access |
| 30 days | Monthly rotation |
| 365 days | Long-lived service accounts |

Short-lived certificates (8h–24h) are recommended for human users. Longer validity is acceptable for automated service accounts.

### Extensions (User Certificates Only)

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| permit-pty | Allow interactive terminal sessions |
| permit-agent-forwarding | Allow SSH agent forwarding |
| permit-X11-forwarding | Allow X11 display forwarding |
| permit-port-forwarding | Allow TCP port forwarding |
| permit-user-rc | Allow execution of ~/.ssh/rc on login |

### Critical Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| force-command | Restrict the certificate to a single command |
| source-address | Restrict to specific source IP addresses/CIDRs |

**Example:** A certificate with \`force-command=ls\` and \`source-address=10.0.0.0/8\` can only run \`ls\` and only from the 10.x.x.x network.

## Using Certificates

### User Certificate
\`\`\`bash
# Place certificate alongside the private key
# If key is ~/.ssh/id_work, certificate must be ~/.ssh/id_work-cert.pub
cp downloaded-cert.pub ~/.ssh/id_work-cert.pub

# SSH automatically uses the certificate
ssh user@server
\`\`\`

### Host Certificate
\`\`\`bash
# On the server: place the host certificate
sudo cp host-cert.pub /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub

# Add to sshd_config
echo "HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
\`\`\`

On clients, add the Host CA to known_hosts:
\`\`\`
@cert-authority *.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
\`\`\`

## Revocation

1. Select a certificate in the table
2. Click **Revoke** in the detail panel
3. The certificate is added to the CA's Key Revocation List (KRL)
4. Download and deploy the updated KRL to servers (from SSH CAs page)

> ⚠ Revocation only takes effect when servers check the KRL via \`RevokedKeys\` in sshd_config.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Permission denied (publickey) | Verify the CA is trusted on the server (TrustedUserCAKeys) |
| Certificate not used | Ensure the cert file is named \`<key>-cert.pub\` next to the private key |
| Principal mismatch | The username you SSH as must be listed in the certificate's principals |
| Certificate expired | Issue a new certificate with appropriate validity |
| Host verification failed | Add the Host CA to known_hosts with @cert-authority |
