# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimate Certificate Manager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Starting with v2.48, UCM uses Major.Build versioning (e.g., 2.48, 2.49). Earlier releases used Semantic Versioning.

## [2.212] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- API keys: proper revoke/delete lifecycle — revoke an active key, permanently delete a revoked or expired one; expired keys no longer count against the per-user limit; "Last used" now shown in the account page (#291, contributed by @Hemsby)
- ACME local domains: bare private TLDs (e.g. `local`, `internal`) can now be registered, covering all their subdomains through the existing parent matching (#290, contributed by @gb-123-git)

### Fixed
- ACME server: http-01 validation now follows HTTP redirects (RFC 8555 §8.3) — a site-wide http→https 301 on the challenge path no longer fails with "Key authorization mismatch". Up to 5 hops, http/https on default ports only, TLS not verified on https hops (the target usually serves the certificate being renewed), and every hop re-vetted by the SSRF policy (cloud metadata always refused; targets resolved, vetted and pinned when private IPs are disallowed)
- Deleting a certificate (single or bulk) or a CA now removes its cert/key/csr files on disk instead of leaving them orphaned (#289, contributed by @Hemsby)
- `app.config['DATA_DIR']` is now set, so the session cleanup task no longer silently falls back to the default data directory on custom layouts (#290, contributed by @gb-123-git)

## [2.211] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Certificates: mutable display name independent from the CN — rename from the certificates list, defaults to CN or first SAN DNS name for CN-less certificates (CA/B Forum profiles, Let's Encrypt tlsserver/shortlived), shown in lists and selectors with the key type to distinguish otherwise identical certificates (#286)

### Fixed
- Packaging: DEB/RPM upgrades no longer silently drop manually installed Kerberos extras (`requests-kerberos`, `pyspnego[kerberos]`) when rebuilding the virtualenv — they are detected before the rebuild and reinstalled after (#287, contributed by @Hemsby)

## [2.210] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- ACME client accounts: multiple accounts can share the same CA directory URL — administrative separation for dns-persist-01 and multi-domain setups (#276)
- DNS providers: Tencent Cloud DNSPod (#284, contributed by @wxtewx)

### Fixed
- ACME CA account form: the directory URL field is no longer marked required, and an empty URL defaults to Let's Encrypt Production — the helper text and the form now agree (#276)
- ACME account key import now documents the accepted legacy PEM envelopes — SEC1/X9.62 (BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY) and PKCS#1 (BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY) already worked but the UI/helper only mentioned PKCS#8 (#285)

## [2.209] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- SCEP profiles: Microsoft Intune challenge validation — live per-device challenge validation against Intune's `ScepActions` API with Entra app registration, forced auto-approve, and success/failure notification before issuance (#228, contributed by @Hemsby)
- ACME client accounts: import the private key of an existing account at creation (algorithm derived from the key) (#277)
- ACME client accounts: deactivate an account upstream (RFC 8555 §7.3.6) — permanent and removes the local record (#278)

### Fixed
- Certificate, SSH certificate, user certificate, and discovered-certificate lists now search the entire inventory (server-side) instead of only the current page (#280)

## [2.208] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- WSTEP: per-template pinned subject fields (C/ST/L/O/OU) — CSR/AD-supplied values overridden, CN/SAN stay dynamic (#274, contributed by @Hemsby)
- WSTEP: AD SID security extension (szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT) on Kerberos-bound issuance for KB5014754 strong certificate mapping (#275, contributed by @Hemsby)

### Fixed
- Kerberos availability check now requires the gssapi backend, not just importable spnego (which ships transitively) — XCEP no longer advertises/attempts a broken Kerberos binding (#273, contributed by @Hemsby)

## [2.207] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Native Windows autoenrollment (MS-XCEP + MS-WSTEP)** (#229, contributed by @Hemsby) — UCM now serves the Active Directory Certificate Services enrollment protocols: MS-XCEP policy discovery (`/ADPolicyProvider_CEP_*` GetPolicies, advertising key usage, EKUs and enrollment URIs to Windows clients) and MS-WSTEP issuance/renewal (`/ADCertificateService_CES_*` RequestSecurityToken — RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection). Three authentication bindings, mirroring real ADCS CES endpoints: WS-Security UsernameToken (with HTTP Basic fallback), client-certificate renewal (the RST must be XML-DSig-signed with the private key of a certificate UCM itself issued — byte-for-byte matched against the stored certificate), and Kerberos/SPNEGO over HTTP `Negotiate` (pyspnego + keytab, optional dependency). A new **AD Connector** (Settings) lets UCM query Active Directory over LDAP(S) — bind password encrypted at rest — to derive the subject of the deliberately-empty CSRs Windows GPO machine autoenrollment submits (machine: `CN=<dNSHostName>`; user, opt-in per template: the AD directory DN as subject plus a UPN `OtherName` SAN, with the AD `mail` attribute opportunistically added). Templates gain three opt-in flags: `autoenroll_enabled` (advertise `autoEnroll=true` in XCEP policy — the Enroll/Autoenroll split real ADCS enforces), `ad_derived_subject`, and `allowed_ad_group` for per-template Enroll ACL via AD group membership (nested groups included). Windows-specific interop details were verified against a live AD lab, including the TLS 1.2 cap required by some schannel clients (applied only while WSTEP is enabled), CMC full-PKCS#7 request unwrapping and response building, the Microsoft Certificate Template extension on issued certs (absence breaks `CX509Enrollment`), UPN SANs, and proof-of-possession enforced on PKCS#7/CMC-wrapped requests.
- **SSH certificate issuance UI** — the certificate type selector now auto-syncs to the selected SSH CA (contributed by @gb-123-git).

### Security
- **Community audit round-up** (contributed by @gb-123-git, #263): path traversal in the update-download helper (unsanitized `package_name` reached a file path), path verification on backup download/delete (filenames are now resolved and confined to the backup directory), SQL-injection hardening of the PostgreSQL sequence-reset helper (compiler-rendered identifiers and bound names, per-column savepoints), missing ownership checks on ACME-proxy resources — account status enforced at new-order, DNS automation only triggers for the order's owner, challenge-to-order attribution fails closed when the upstream CA omits the `Link rel="up"` header (legacy orders recorded before ownership tracking intentionally keep read access) — IDOR fixes on user-certificate revoke/delete, SSO provider secrets no longer returned to non-admins requesting `include_secrets`, CA export password removed from the URL query string (out of access logs), LDAP bind passwords encrypted at rest, and security-sensitive settings (session/lockout/HSTS/public-URL/password-policy keys) now require `admin:settings`, with the settings UI locking those fields for operators instead of failing the whole card save.
- **WebSocket security overhaul** (contributed by @gb-123-git, #263): socket handshakes previously skipped authentication entirely, so any connection received every certificate/CA broadcast, and authenticated clients could subscribe to arbitrary rooms. Connections now authenticate through the Flask session (or an API key scoped to its owner's current permissions, with mandatory periodic re-authentication) and fail closed on error, events are emitted to server-managed permission-scoped rooms only, clients cannot leave mandatory rooms or join privileged ones without the underlying permissions, subscriptions are rate-limited, sessions are periodically re-validated against the auth manager, and API-key authentication in the URL query string is deliberately unsupported.
- **WSTEP certificate-bound renewal requires the exact issued certificate** — renewal originally recognized the signing certificate by serial number alone; serial and subject are public, so a forged self-signed lookalike bearing a victim's serial/subject could renew a victim's identity onto an attacker's key. The presented certificate must now match the stored certificate byte-for-byte for the configured CA, and the DB lookup tolerates all serial storage formats (`serial_variants()`; ARI reuses the same helper).

### Fixed
- **Empty-subject CSRs with an IP-only SAN now populate the CN from that IP** — the populate-CN-from-SAN fallback only looked at DNS names, so `certbot`-style CSRs whose single SAN is an IP address produced certificates with a genuinely empty subject (some clients, notably Safari on iOS, reject those) (#271, contributed by @Hemsby).
- **SSH CA download/copy public-key buttons** and the missing `openssh-client` package in the Docker image for KRL generation (contributed by @gb-123-git).
- Kerberos keytab-validation tests now skip when the optional `gssapi` extra is not installed (CI environments without the Kerberos libraries), rather than failing.

## [2.206] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Optional purge of replaced ACME-proxy certificates** (#240) — new opt-in ACME setting `acme.proxy.prune_replaced_certificates` (UI toggle under ACME → Let's Encrypt proxy): when a proxy order finalizes, certificates previously imported by proxy orders for the exact same domain set are deleted instead of piling up in the inventory. Revoked certificates are always kept, and certificates not issued through the proxy are never touched. Off by default. (Note: the proxy never stores the client's private key in the first place — keys stay client-side by design of ACME CSRs.)
- **CRL validity window extended to 5 years for offline CAs** (#236) — `validity_days` now accepts 1–1825 (was 1–365) and the CRL/OCSP page offers 90d/180d/1y/3y/5y options, with a warning past one year since relying parties may keep stale revocation data for the full window. Intended for offline root CAs that cannot re-sign CRLs on schedule; online CAs should stay at short validity.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate CA/certificate creation on double-submit** (#269) — the Create CA modal and Issue Certificate form never disabled their submit button, so a double-click (or Enter+click) during a slow RSA keygen created two identical objects. Both forms now ignore re-entrant submissions and disable the button while one is in flight.

## [2.205] - 2026-08-07

### Security
- **ACME proxy endpoints now verify resource ownership** — the proxy's authorization, challenge, order-status and certificate-download endpoints verified the JWS signature but never checked that the requesting account owned the resource: any account registered on the proxy could read any other account's authorization status and challenge details, poll their orders, and download their certificates by enumerating the base64-encoded upstream identifiers (the native ACME server was not affected — it has enforced this binding all along). Every order-scoped proxy endpoint now enforces the owner binding recorded at new-order (account id and/or client JWK thumbprint), the same check finalize already performed: a foreign account gets `unauthorized` (403), and an owner-bound resource whose requester identity cannot be derived fails closed. Because challenge and authorization URLs live in disjoint namespaces on most CAs, a challenge is attributed to its order through the authorization URL the upstream CA itself returns in the `Link rel="up"` header, never by guessing from the URL shape. Resources no longer tracked by any proxy order (e.g. the order row was deleted) now return 404 instead of being fetched upstream; orders created before ownership tracking existed carry no binding and are served as before. Reported by @gb-123-git (#260).
- **Trusted-proxy gate vs ProxyFix `REMOTE_ADDR` rewrite** — with `UCM_BEHIND_PROXY=1` (or `UCM_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS>0`), Werkzeug's ProxyFix rewrites `REMOTE_ADDR` from `X-Forwarded-For` before the trusted-proxy gate ran. Two consequences: requests arriving through a configured reverse proxy failed the check (every nginx-proxied Web UI request was 403'd with "Untrusted X-Forwarded-Host from non-proxy client", and mTLS / EST client-cert headers from the proxy were ignored); and a direct attacker who could reach the backend could *pass* the gate by sending `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`, unlocking `SSL_CLIENT_*` / `X-SSL-Client-*` header handling used for client-certificate authentication. Trust decisions now key on the real TCP peer preserved in `werkzeug.proxy_fix.orig` (`utils.trusted_proxy.immediate_peer_addr()`), `client_ip()` trusts ProxyFix's hop-aware result when it rewrote `REMOTE_ADDR` instead of re-parsing client-supplied XFF entries (the legacy `X-Real-IP` fallback is kept when ProxyFix found nothing to apply), spoof-attempt warning logs report the real peer, and the mTLS middleware reuses the shared gate instead of its own duplicated (equally affected) check.


### Fixed
- **Navigation highlight now derives the active item from the URL path** — the active page was derived from the first URL segment under a "segment === nav item id" naming convention, so every route that breaks the convention never highlighted and its sidebar group never auto-expanded: `/key-recovery` (nav id `keyRecovery`) and the SSH pages `/ssh/cas` and `/ssh/certificates` (nav ids `ssh-cas`/`ssh-certificates`) were permanently unhighlighted, while `scep-config`, `est-config` and `tsa-config` only worked through a hand-maintained exception map. The active item is now resolved by matching each nav item's `path` (exact match first, then longest prefix so detail pages like `/cas/123` still highlight their section), which keeps the highlight correct by construction for any future nav item. The Key Recovery contextual help panel, gated on the same broken id, now opens as well.
- **EST settings no longer reject a fresh CA selection when the previously configured CA was deleted** — deleting a CA leaves its `est_ca_refid` value behind, and `GET /api/v2/est/config` keeps returning that stale refid (reporting `ca_id: null`); the settings page PATCHes the whole object back, so the stale refid arrived alongside the fresh `ca_id` and the update handler, which validated `ca_refid` first, answered `CA not found` before ever looking at the valid selection. When both fields are sent, `ca_id` is now authoritative; a `ca_refid`-only request is validated exactly as before.
- **SSH CA TTL fields accept the duration format the UI advertises** — the create/edit placeholders say "e.g. 24h, 7d, 365d", but `default_ttl`/`max_ttl` were cast with a bare `int()`, so `365d` was rejected with `invalid literal for int()` (and the import path stored the raw string, crashing later at issuance). All three entry points (create, update, import) now normalize through `utils.duration.parse_duration_seconds()` — plain numbers stay valid as seconds, `s/m/h/d/w/y` suffixes are accepted, and malformed values fail with a clear 400 naming the accepted formats.
- **Approved issuance (policy workflow) now honors the certificate template** — when a deferred certificate request finalized after approval, the legacy approval issuance path ignored the template's Key Usage / Extended Key Usage, used hardcoded cert-type profiles, always signed with SHA-256 (ignoring the template digest), fell back to its own request defaults instead of the template's key type/validity, stored the resulting private key unencrypted, dropped the `template_id` linkage, and skipped the CA-expiration sanity check. The approval path now applies the template's extensions template / digest / defaults like the direct issuance path (#226), encrypts the issued private key via `encrypt_private_key`, preserves the template link with `template_overrides` (#258), and refuses validity beyond the CA's own end-of-life.

### Added
- **Custom Command DNS provider for ACME DNS-01** — a new DNS provider type (`custom_command`) running admin-configured local commands for TXT record create/delete, with record details passed through environment variables (`DOMAIN`, `RECORD_NAME`, `RECORD_VALUE`, `TTL`, `ACTION`). This is the escape hatch for DNS providers not natively supported (#249 — e.g. nicmanager or any of lego's 220 drivers reached through a small wrapper script); lego itself ships no record-level CLI, so a direct binary call was not possible. Hardened: absolute binary path required, no shell (argv-split, no pipes), hard timeout (5–300 s, default 60), output truncated in error reports. The command binaries must exist and be executable or the provider test reports it.
- **dns-persist-01 ACME challenge support** (draft-ietf-acme-dns-persist-01) — the built-in ACME server can now authorize DNS identifiers via a persistent TXT record at `_validation-persist.<fqdn>` bound to the requester's ACME account (`accounturi`) and an issuer-domain-name, so clients renew without writing DNS records. Opt-in under ACME settings, off by default: persistent validation ties issuance capability to the account key for the record's lifetime (draft §7.2), and the UI states this on toggle. `policy=wildcard` is honored for wildcard/subdomain scope (draft §5/§6), `persistUntil` rejects new validations past its timestamp, malformed records produce ACME `malformed` errors, account mismatches `unauthorized`. Issuer-domain-names come from the configured CAA identifiers, falling back to the ACME public hostname. Challenges still expire per the normal ACME authorization lifecycle.
- **`acme.dns01_nameservers` accepts `host:port` entries** — the optional authoritative-resolver override (used by DNS-01 and dns-persist-01 validation) can now point at resolvers not listening on port 53 (e.g. a loopback-only BIND or a dnsmasq instance on an alternate port). Comma-separated as before; plain IPs still work.
- **Certificates issued from a template now record how they diverged from it** — key type, validity and digest are template defaults that a request may legitimately override (issue #226 shipped that behavior); the issued certificate keeps its template link and now records which of those values were explicitly overridden (#258, option 2 debated there). The certificate detail shows the template name with a "modified from template" indicator listing the divergent fields, and the certificate list gains a Template filter to find diverged certificates. The record is written at issuance and frozen — editing the template later does not rewrite history. The value is exposed as `template_overrides` (list of field names) in the certificate API responses; renewals at par keep it.

### Fixed
- **mTLS reverse-proxy certificate headers never honored** — the mTLS middleware, `login_mtls()`, `/api/v2/auth/methods`, and `/api/v2/mtls/enroll` all matched `X-SSL-Client-*` names against `dict(request.headers)`, whose keys WSGI reconstructs title-cased (`X-Ssl-Client-Verify`), so the exact-case `in` checks never matched and client-certificate authentication through nginx/apache proxy headers silently never fired (the designed spoof-attempt warnings were equally dead). All four sites now use `request.headers` directly, which is case-insensitive.

## [2.204] - 2026-08-01

### Security
- **Direct private-key export now requires an admin-only scope** — exporting a certificate's private key (`include_key`, or a `pkcs12`/`pfx`/`key`/`jks` format) required only `write:certificates`, which the `operator` role holds by default — the very role that would otherwise go through the approval-gated Key Recovery flow. That made the four-eyes approval pointless: an operator could simply export the key directly, unapproved. Private-key export is now gated behind the admin-only `read:private_keys` scope; roles without it must use Key Recovery. CA private-key export was already restricted (`write:cas`) and is unchanged. **Upgrade note:** operators can no longer export certificate private keys directly — grant `read:private_keys` to a role (or use an admin account / admin-scoped API key) where direct export is required, otherwise route it through Key Recovery. Reported in #232.
- **ACME finalize rejects certificate requests carrying identities the order never validated** — only DNS and IP subject alternative names were compared against the order's identifiers, and the CSR's SAN extension was copied verbatim onto the issued certificate: a client that legitimately passed a challenge for its own domain could also smuggle an email address (rfc822Name) or a Windows UPN (otherName) into the certificate — S/MIME impersonation, or AD logon as another user against a CA trusted for smartcard logon. Every SAN entry must now match a validated order identifier; any other general-name type is refused with a `badCSR` error. Contributed by @heidrickla (#242).
- **Key strength is enforced on every issuance path** — the RSA ≥ 2048 / P-256+ floor documented for enrollment was only applied by SCEP and EST; a weak-key CSR (e.g. RSA-1024) was signed without complaint through the admin Sign-CSR endpoint and ACME finalize. The floor now lives in the signing service itself, so all paths inherit it. **Upgrade note:** weak-key CSRs now fail everywhere with an explicit message; there is no opt-out — re-key the requesting system. Contributed by @heidrickla (#243).
- **CSR-supplied Extended Key Usages are capped to the certificate type's profile** — whatever EKUs a CSR carried were copied onto the certificate (minus only OCSPSigning/timeStamping), so a protocol enrollee could mint itself a code-signing certificate through ACME. Protocol paths now honor only the EKUs the resolved certificate type permits; `anyExtendedKeyUsage` and Smartcard Logon are never honored from a CSR. Operators keep full control through the explicit extra-EKUs option when signing. A follow-up closes the resulting corner cases: a CSR whose EKUs are all disallowed no longer yields a certificate with the EKU extension omitted entirely (which would be unrestricted) on any issuance path, SCEP included, and renewals preserve the certificate's existing EKUs at par instead of narrowing them to the default profile (#254). Contributed by @heidrickla (#243).
- **Sub-CA creation through Sign-CSR is gated and pathLen-clamped** — signing a CSR as `intermediate_ca` only required certificate-signing permissions and copied the CSR's BasicConstraints (pathLen included) unchecked. It now additionally requires `write:cas`, and the sub-CA's pathLen is clamped below the parent's (refused outright under a pathLen-0 parent), per RFC 5280 §4.2.1.9. A follow-up extends the same clamp to sub-CAs created via `POST /cas` (previously left unbounded under a constrained parent) and to the default CSR shape that carries no BasicConstraints (#254). Contributed by @heidrickla (#243).
- **The private-address guard applies to ACME IP-address orders** — both challenge validators skipped the SSRF check for RFC 8738 `ip` identifiers (it was gated on the identifier being a DNS name), so a deployment that had explicitly disabled `allow_private_ips` still fetched challenges from private and link-local addresses, including cloud metadata endpoints. Deployments using the default (private IPs allowed — the on-prem use case) are unaffected. A follow-up additionally refuses cloud-metadata and link-local targets unconditionally — even when private IPs are allowed — and rejects malformed DNS identifiers before validation (#256). Contributed by @heidrickla (#244).
- **Missing encryption keys are loud, and can be made fatal** — without a configured database encryption key, integration secrets are protected by a key derived from the machine id (world-readable, routinely captured in backups and images), and without private-key encryption enabled, CA and certificate keys are stored unencrypted — both silently. Both conditions are now logged at startup, and two opt-in environment variables (`UCM_REQUIRE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `UCM_REQUIRE_KEY_ENCRYPTION`) refuse to run without explicit keys. **Upgrade note:** startup behavior is unchanged for existing deployments and existing data stays readable; the new startup error on installs that never enabled private-key encryption is informational — enable it under Settings → Security. A follow-up makes the require-flags refuse at startup (rather than on first secret use), treats an invalid key as fatal instead of silently falling back to plaintext, refuses the disable-encryption path up front, and accepts `1`/`yes`/`on` like every other toggle (#252). Contributed by @heidrickla (#245).
- **mTLS, API-key, TSA, CSRF, SSH and OCSP hardening** — issuing an mTLS client certificate now requires `write:user_certificates` (it accepted any authenticated role, and fell back to an arbitrary CA when none was configured); API keys are capped at auth time to their owner's *current* effective permissions, so a key minted by a since-demoted operator no longer keeps its old scopes (**upgrade note:** keys whose owner lost roles or groups lose those scopes immediately — re-mint under an appropriate owner if an integration breaks); the mTLS enrollment endpoints lost their CSRF exemption; SSH certificate extension requests are validated against the CA's configured extension list; OCSP nonces are bounded per RFC 8954; a new opt-in TSA setting can require a dedicated timestamping certificate (the endpoint itself remains public, as RFC 3161 requires); and 2FA recovery codes work again — login compared a truncated prefix, so account recovery by code always failed. A follow-up expands a stored `read:*`/`write:*` API-key scope to the owner's current permissions instead of dropping it on demotion, preserves an explicitly empty SSH extension policy (it was collapsing back to the full default set), and requires `write:cas` on the explicit-CA mTLS path (#253). Contributed by @heidrickla (#246).
- **Deployment and CI defaults hardened** — the standalone database initializer now flags the seeded admin for a forced password change like every other bootstrap path; the Docker environment example no longer ships a working database password; the development compose file binds the debugger to loopback; the Trivy CI action is pinned to a release SHA; OPNsense imports verify TLS by default (**upgrade note:** API callers that relied on the old default must pass `verify_ssl: false` explicitly — the UI checkbox is unchanged); and EST behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy requires an explicit verification-success header instead of treating its absence as success (**upgrade note:** proxies must forward `ssl_client_verify`; clients fall back to HTTP Basic authentication otherwise). A follow-up completes the compose fix (the base file still published the application ports on 0.0.0.0), aligns the OPNsense verify-TLS default in the UI, and repairs a destructive database-reset path that dropped the schema without reseeding an admin (#255). Contributed by @heidrickla (#248).
- **The ACME Terms-of-Service text no longer interpolates HTML — in the admin preview or on the public terms page** — the preview was built by a hand-rolled regex sanitizer whose output went to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; it did not escape double quotes and never validated link schemes, so admin-supplied ToS text was stored XSS against any operator viewing the ACME settings page. The public, unauthenticated `/acme/terms` page rendered the same stored text server-side with the identical missing-quote escape, so a quote in a ToS URL could inject attributes there too. The preview now renders through ReactMarkdown with an http/https/mailto scheme allowlist (bare-URL autolinking, single-newline line breaks and list styling are preserved), and the server-side renderer escapes quotes before autolinking. Both are defence in depth — the CSP already blocked inline script execution on modern browsers. Contributed by @heidrickla (#247).
- **ACME finalize now validates the CSR subject, not just its SANs** — the SAN-type check added in #242 was bypassable through the certificate subject. A CSR with no SAN extension still had a SAN synthesized from its subject when signed, so an order that only proved a DNS name could finalize with `emailAddress=ceo@victim.com` in the subject and receive a certificate asserting that address — an identity the account never proved, which email-based client-certificate identity mapping (mTLS, EAP-TLS, VPN) trusts. Separately, only the first commonName was ever compared to the order, so a second `CN=admin.victim.com` rode onto the certificate unvalidated — and because the name UCM stores and displays is read from the reversed RFC 4514 subject, that smuggled name even became the identity shown for the certificate. Finalize now requires every commonName to be a validated order identifier and refuses any emailAddress in the subject, with the same `badCSR` error. Contributed by @heidrickla (#251).

### Fixed
- **User groups can be given permissions from the UI, and the help text is accurate** — group permissions have been enforced since 2.201 (a member's effective permissions are their role's unioned with those of their groups), but the group form only exposed name and description, so there was no way to actually set them — and the Users/Groups and RBAC help described a non-existent "assign a role to a group" model. The group form now has a permission picker (limited to the grantable set, never `admin:*`/`*`), the group detail panel lists a group's permissions, and the help now describes how group permissions actually work. Reported in #233.
- **A certificate with more than one commonName is recorded under the right one** — the stored and displayed `subject_cn` was taken by splitting the subject's RFC 4514 string on `,` and keeping the first `CN=` token, but that format emits RDNs in *reverse* order, so the token found was the **last** commonName. A certificate whose subject was `CN=web.example.com, CN=admin.example.com` was listed, searched and exported as `admin.example.com`. The same split also ignored RFC 4514's `\,` escape, so a comma inside another attribute (`O=Example, Inc.`) could truncate the name. Both recorders — the admin signing path and SCEP — now read the commonName from the subject itself, which is also how ACME validates it, so the name checked and the name recorded can no longer disagree. Existing rows are unchanged; re-issuing a certificate corrects its recorded name. Contributed by @heidrickla (#257).
- **Backend error messages reach the UI again** — RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` error bodies were read as plain text by the frontend's content-type check, so the backend's specific message (e.g. which password rule failed at user creation) was discarded in favor of a generic per-status string. Reported in #234, contributed by @Hemsby (#237).
- **Settings save buttons only submit their own section** — every Save button on the General, Security, Backup and Audit tabs sent the entire settings object, so an invalid field in one card silently blocked saving an unrelated one, and the Password Policy and 2FA cards had no Save button of their own at all. Each button now owns exactly its card's fields, and both cards got their own button. Contributed by @Hemsby (#238).
- **The Microsoft CA connection Save button carries its icon again**, matching the other buttons in the row. Contributed by @Hemsby (#239).
- **CRL scheduler no longer errors on offline CAs** — a CA taken offline in password-protected mode keeps its (passphrase-encrypted) key in the database, so the scheduler still selected it for CRL regeneration and raised "Password was not given but private key is encrypted" on every cycle. Offline CAs are now skipped (with a debug log), for both base and delta CRLs, consistent with every other signing path.

### Added
- **Per-EAB domain restrictions** — an EAB credential can be limited to the domains it may request certificates for: `*` (any), `*.example.com` (all sub-domains), or an explicit list; an empty list blocks issuance entirely. Enforced on ACME new-order and new-authz, on both the built-in ACME server and the proxy. Existing credentials stay unrestricted (`*`) after upgrade and new credentials default to unrestricted, so nothing breaks. Restrictions are only meaningful when EAB is required (`acme_eab_required`), since otherwise clients can register without an EAB credential (migration 069). Implements #241, contributed by @gb-123-git (#259).
- **SCEP profiles — multiple enrollment endpoints** — named profiles served at `/scep/<profile>/pkiclient.exe`, each bound to its own CA, optional certificate template (whose key usage, extended key usage and validity govern issuance), challenge password (encrypted at rest, with the same expiry window as the global challenge) and approval policy. Device certs, user certs or per-tenant enrollments each get a dedicated URL instead of sharing one global endpoint; the existing `/scep/pkiclient.exe` endpoints keep serving the global configuration unchanged. Managed from a new Profiles tab on the SCEP page (migration 068). Requested in #228, and groundwork for Intune dynamic challenge validation.
- **Delegated OCSP responder certificates renew automatically** — a daily task re-issues a responder certificate before it expires (same key pair and extensions, renewed at par) and rebinds the CA's responder configuration to the new certificate, so a short-lived OCSP signing certificate (e.g. the 90-day system template) rotates without manual action. Enabled by default; can be disabled and the renewal window tuned via configuration. Requested in #226.
- **Template key type and validity are honored at issuance via the API** — an issuance request carrying a `template_id` but no `key_type`/`validity_days` now inherits them from the template (the UI already prefilled them); explicit request values still win. Requested in #226.

## [2.203] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **TSA works again for existing installations** — 2.200 required the timestamp signer to carry a critical, exclusive `timeStamping` EKU, but the signer is the configured CA's own certificate, which carries no EKU at all: every deployment that timestamped before the upgrade got a 503 on all requests, and the product offered no way to mint a compliant signer. A CA certificate is accepted again (with a recommendation to use a dedicated TSA certificate), the new `tsa_enabled` gate no longer refuses installs that configured a TSA CA before the flag existed, and a client-pinned `reqPolicy` is honored by issuing under that policy (RFC 3161 §2.4.1) instead of rejecting.
- **ACME issuance no longer fails closed on CAA DNS errors** — 2.200 turned any CAA lookup failure (SERVFAIL, timeout, unreachable resolver) into a denial and terminally invalidated the order, which broke every renewal on air-gapped and split-horizon networks. DNS errors are non-blocking again by default (a warning is logged); strict fail-closed behaviour is available with the new "fail issuance on DNS lookup errors" toggle, and a transient DNS error never invalidates the order anymore. An RFC 8657 `validationmethods` parameter is no longer enforced when the validation method is indeterminable (reused or auto-approved authorizations).
- **Renewals are no longer blocked by CA name constraints** — 2.200 started validating renewals against the chain's NameConstraints, so certificates legitimately issued before enforcement (or before constraints were tightened) became un-renewable and fleets stranded at expiry; scheduled auto-renewal even swallowed the failure silently. Renewal-at-par now graces the names a certificate already carries (single, bulk, scheduled, SCEP and EST renewals) — only names *new* to the request are enforced — and auto-renewal failures are recorded in the audit trail. A CN that is not hostname-shaped (e.g. a person's name) is no longer treated as a DNS identity, and an unparseable NameConstraints extension no longer blocks all issuance from that CA.
- **SCEP accepts legacy clients again** — 2.200 required a 16-byte senderNonce and an in-window signingTime, and matched the RecipientInfo byte-for-byte against the CA certificate, which rejected fleets of already-enrolled devices (pre-RFC clients, devices without NTP, embedded stacks that re-encode the issuer). All three checks are tolerant again by default (warnings are logged); signingTime enforcement and its clock-skew window are configurable. GetCACert on an intermediate CA returns the single CA certificate again — the `application/x-x509-ca-ra-cert` chain response broke Apple/MDM enrollment (error -67731) — with the full-chain response available as an option. A renewal no longer silently strips EKUs the device's current certificate already carries.
- **EST accepts legacy integrations again** — 2.200 returned 415 unless the request carried `Content-Type: application/pkcs10` (breaking plain curl scripts) and refused PEM-encoded CSR bodies; both are accepted again with a deprecation warning. Re-enrollment no longer rejects a CSR whose SubjectAltName entries are reordered or differ only in criticality, and a CSR without SAN is issued as before. Clients that need the CA chain in the enroll response (instead of `/cacerts`) can opt in.
- **Syslog forwarding keeps line framing on upgrade** — 2.200 silently switched TCP+TLS syslog to RFC 6587 octet-counting, corrupting the stream for collectors that only speak newline framing, with no way back from the UI. Existing configurations are pinned to line framing on upgrade (migration 066) and the framing is now an explicit setting.
- **Revoked certificates can no longer answer `good` from the OCSP cache after upgrade** — cache entries written before 2.200 (whose revocation-invalidation was broken) are purged once at upgrade (migration 066).
- **Wildcard ACME authorizations created before 2.200 are reusable again** — they were stored in a format the new reuse lookup never matched, forcing a dns-01 re-validation on the first renewal (fatal with certbot --manual). Existing rows are normalized at upgrade (migration 067).
- **UCM-managed ACME renewals recover when the upstream rejects `replaces`** — the RFC 9773 renewal hint is retried without the field on rejection instead of failing every renewal cycle until expiry.
- **A failed MS CA rekey submission no longer leaves the certificate paired with the wrong key** — the freshly generated key/CSR are rolled back when the submission errors or is denied, so a PKCS#12 export cannot bundle a key that never got signed.
- **Admin Sign-CSR can issue delegated OCSP responder and TSA certificates again** — 2.200 silently stripped the `OCSPSigning`/`timeStamping` EKUs on every path, including the operator explicitly signing a responder's CSR; the strip now applies only to protocol enrollees (ACME/EST), is logged, and can no longer be smuggled back in through the extra-EKUs merge.
- **OIDC provider settings are fully configurable in the UI** — 2.200 enabled ID-token verification by default but the issuer, JWKS URI and verification toggle it relies on were never exposed, so existing OIDC providers failed closed with no way to fix them without manual API calls (#227).

### Added
- **Settings previously configurable only by direct database edits now have UI and API coverage**: Certificate Transparency SCT embedding and the require-SCTs policy (with an updated default log list), OCSP response validity window, CAA issuer identifiers and enforcement mode, SCEP signingTime enforcement/clock skew/GetCACert chain, EST chain-in-response, syslog TLS verification and TCP framing, and the ACME client's TLS-ALPN-01 port. TLS-ALPN-01 (RFC 8737) is selectable when requesting certificates through the ACME client.
- **Templates now govern the issued certificate's Key Usage and Extended Key Usage** — issuing from a template previously ignored its configured KU/EKU entirely: the certificate type's built-in profile was applied instead and its EKUs were always merged in, so a template restricted to `OCSPSigning` still produced a certificate carrying `serverAuth`. When a template is selected its `extensions_template` is now the source of truth (extra EKUs are still added on top), and the certificate type selector in the issue form is disabled since the template defines it. Reported in #226.
- **Changing a template's type now updates its Key Usage / Extended Key Usage checkboxes** — the type selector previously changed nothing in the form, so every new template started from the web-server defaults regardless of the chosen type. Reported in #226.

### Added
- **`custom` certificate type at issuance** — imposes no Extended Key Usage: only the EKUs you pick end up in the certificate, and with none selected the EKU extension is omitted entirely. This makes single-purpose certificates (e.g. an OCSP responder with only `OCSPSigning`) possible from the issue form. Requested in #226.
- **OCSP Signing system template** (`ocsp_signing` type) — delegated OCSP responder profile (RFC 6960): `digitalSignature` + `OCSPSigning` only, 90-day validity. Existing installations receive it automatically on upgrade. `OCSPSigning` is also selectable in the template editor's EKU checkboxes. Requested in #226.

## [2.202] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Security keys stopped working after upgrading to 2.200** — signature-counter clone detection began being enforced against a stored value that earlier releases had incremented on every login, including for the many authenticators (platform passkeys, and most FIDO2 keys) that always report a counter of zero. Those users could never present a value high enough and were locked out of their own key with `Authentication failed`. Clone detection is now only applied when the authenticator actually maintains a counter, and the inflated stored values are reset once on upgrade (migration 065); a genuine counter that fails to increase is still refused.
- **Test runs no longer write to the production log** — the suite inherited the native logging configuration and appended to `/var/log/ucm/ucm.log`. On a host that also runs UCM this polluted real logs and, when the suite ran as a different user, took ownership of the file at rotation — after which the service could no longer write its own log at all.
- **Access log was never written** — the WebSocket-capable Gunicorn worker bypassed Gunicorn's access logger entirely, so `/var/log/ucm/access.log` stayed empty on every native install no matter how many requests were served. This made it impossible to tell whether a protocol client (SCEP/EST/ACME) had even reached the server when troubleshooting. Requests are logged again.
- **EST and TSA configuration refusals are now logged** — same gap as SCEP: an unknown EST label, an unconfigured EST CA, a disabled TSA, and a TSA CA that is missing or has no certificate/key all returned an error to the client without recording anything. Contributed by @Hemsby (#224).
- **SCEP configuration refusals are now logged** — a request that reached the server and was turned away by a configuration check (CA offline, no private key, HSM-backed CA, no CA assigned) returned a 500 without recording anything, which was indistinguishable in the log from a request that never arrived. Each refusal now names its reason and the CA involved. Reported by @Hemsby.
- **Inbound SCEP requests are now logged** — only failures were recorded, so a silent log was ambiguous between "the device never reached us" and "it reached us and succeeded". Each request now logs its operation, HTTP method, source address and client User-Agent.

## [2.201] - 2026-07-22

### Security
- **Group permissions are now enforced** — `Group.permissions` was stored and editable but never consulted by authorization, so every grant made through a group was silently inert. A user's effective permissions are now their role's unioned with those of their groups, and the login response advertises the same set the API enforces. Groups can only grant permissions that are actually enforced (the previous list offered `read:certs` while endpoints require `read:certificates`) and can **never** grant `admin:*` or the `*` wildcard, so group membership is not a path to administrator. Permissions outside that set are ignored on read as well as on write, so a value introduced by an old backup or direct SQL stays inert.
- **SCEP challenge passwords now expire** — `scep_challenge_validity` was validated and stored but never applied, leaving a leaked challenge usable indefinitely. The challenge generation time is recorded and enrollment is refused once the configured window has passed. An expired challenge is an explicit refusal rather than a fall-through to the weaker no-challenge path, and renewals keep working since they authenticate with the existing certificate. Challenges created before this release are adopted on first use rather than expired on the spot, so upgrading does not lock out a deployed fleet. The challenge API now reports `expired` and `expires_at`.

### Added
- **EST CA labels** (RFC 7030 §3.2.2) — EST operations are now also served under `/.well-known/est/<label>/…`, letting one deployment expose several CAs. Opt-in: map labels to CAs in the `est_labels` system setting (JSON, label → CA reference); with none configured only the existing unlabelled endpoints exist and behaviour is unchanged. An unknown label returns 404 and never falls back to the default CA, so a client is never enrolled against an authority it did not address.
- **RFC 7807 problem details on API errors** — error responses now carry the standard `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` and `instance` members and are served as `application/problem+json`. **Not a breaking change:** the historical `error`, `message` and `code` keys are still present alongside them, so existing API clients and integrations keep working unchanged. Authentication, permission and unrouted-path errors follow the same shape as handler errors.
- **ACME certificate profiles** (draft-ietf-acme-profiles) — the directory can advertise named issuance profiles under `meta.profiles`, and clients select one with the `profile` field in newOrder; the selected profile drives the issued certificate's validity and signature digest, and is echoed on the order. Opt-in: configure the `acme_profiles` system setting (a JSON map of name → `description`/`validity_days`/`digest`); with none configured the directory advertises no profiles and behaviour is unchanged. An unknown or malformed profile is rejected with `invalidProfile` (migration 064).

## [2.200] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **ACME client protocol coverage** — upstream certificate revocation through the proxy (previously answered 501), ARI consumption (RFC 9773: suggested renewal windows and the `replaces` field on renewal orders), TLS-ALPN-01 challenge support (RFC 8737) and IP identifiers (RFC 8738).
- **ACME server conformance (RFC 8555)** — registered error types (`badNonce`, `badRevocationReason`, `caa`…), full order/authorization state machine (`processing`, `expired`, authorization failures propagate to the order), subproblem documents (§6.7.1), contact validation (`unsupportedContact`/`invalidContact`), `error` field exposed on orders, EAB `protected.url` verification, `application/jose+json` content type, ARI `replaces` tracking (migration 063).
- **SCEP (RFC 8894)** — GetCert and GetCRL operations, mandatory 16-byte senderNonce, intermediate chain in GetCACert (degenerate PKCS#7), signingTime validation, signed GetNextCACert, AES-128-CBC encryption, PasswordRecipientInfo with PBKDF2 for non-RSA clients, strict SignerInfo/RecipientInfo/eContentType validation.
- **OCSP (RFC 6960)** — multi-certificate requests (§4.1.1), unknown critical request extensions answered with `malformedRequest`, delegated responder validation (issued by the CA, within validity, OCSPSigning EKU), configurable response validity window.
- **CAA (RFC 8657/8659)** — `accounturi` and `validationmethods` parameters enforced during ACME issuance, fail-closed on critical flags and on DNS failures (SERVFAIL/timeout), `iodef` reports logged.
- **EST (RFC 7030)** — strict `application/pkcs10` content type, certs-only responses (`smime-type=certs-only`), subject+SAN comparison on re-enroll, unauthenticated `/csrattrs`, spec-conformant server-side key generation (CMS EnvelopedData §4.4).
- **TSA (RFC 3161)** — `reqPolicy` validation (`unacceptedPolicy` on mismatch), signer EKU `timeStamping` verification, hash algorithm aligned with the message imprint, per-token audit.
- **Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962)** — pre-certificate submission flow (`add-pre-chain`) with the SCT list embedded as an X.509 extension in the issued certificate (opt-in `ct_embed_sct`, with `ct_required` enforcement).
- **Misc protocol hardening** — syslog RFC 6587 octet-counting framing with TLS verify option, WebAuthn authenticator clone detection (signature counter), SSH CA allowed-principals patterns (fnmatch) with CA/cert type checks, Kerberos PKINIT EKU in the EKU catalog, RFC 4514 LDAP DN parsing.

### Security
- **OCSP cache invalidated on revocation** — revoking a certificate now purges every cached OCSP response for it (per-algorithm cache entries were missed), so revoked certificates stop being reported `good` immediately (RFC 6960 §2.2). Nonced responses are no longer cached, and lookups are scoped to the issuing CA to prevent cross-CA serial collisions.
- **ACME POST-as-GET enforced** — orders, authorizations and certificates now require a signed JWS request; they were previously readable without authentication (`renewalInfo` stays public per RFC 9773).
- **OIDC SSO id_token verification** — signature, issuer, audience, expiry and nonce are now validated against the provider's JWKS (discovery with key caching, fail-closed; migration 062). **Upgrade note:** verification defaults to on; existing OIDC providers must have their **issuer** (and JWKS URI, or a discoverable issuer) configured in Settings → SSO, otherwise OIDC logins fail closed with "OIDC issuer is not configured" until set. Verification can be turned off per provider if needed.
- **Name constraints enforced on every issuance path** — the subject and SANs are validated against the NameConstraints of the whole CA chain (not just the direct issuer) on web, ACME, EST, SCEP, renewal and approval-policy issuance; unauthorized CSR extensions are filtered from issued certificates.
- **Delegated-authority EKUs restricted for protocol enrollees** — certificates issued from a CSR via ACME/EST/SCEP can no longer carry `id-kp-OCSPSigning` or `id-kp-timeStamping`, which would otherwise let a domain-validated client mint an OCSP delegated responder for the whole CA.
- **SCEP GetNextCACert response is now signed** as required by RFC 8894.
- **Certificate Transparency policy applied on all issuance paths** — SCT embedding and the `ct_required` gate now apply to ACME- and EST-issued certificates, not only the web issuance path.

### Fixed
- **ACME pre-authorization** (RFC 8555 §7.4.1) crashed when validating a challenge on an authorization not bound to an order.
- **ACME wildcard orders** kept the `*.` prefix in the authorization identifier and omitted the `wildcard: true` flag.
- **CRL scheduler** used delta CRL metadata to decide full-CRL regeneration timing.
- **Microsoft AD CS: admin channel test now uses the form's unsaved values** — changing e.g. the WinRM transport no longer requires saving before testing, and a test never persists anything.
- **Microsoft AD CS: inventory sync no longer duplicates certificates signed through UCM** — deduplication matches the CA's RequestId and compares serial numbers under both byte orders (`certutil` reports serials with reversed byte pairs).
- **Microsoft AD CS: imported certificates can now be renewed** — when the original CSR/key is not in UCM, renewal generates a fresh key pair and a CSR with the same subject and SANs (rekey) and submits it to the issuing connection; a "No Key" badge on the certificate detail makes key-less imports explicit.
- **SSH host CA setup script** printed an API signing example with a nonexistent endpoint and the CA name where its id belongs.

## [2.199] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **ACME proxy advertises Renewal Information (ARI, RFC 9773)** — the proxy directory now exposes a `renewalInfo` endpoint served locally from the stored certificate, so ACME clients can schedule renewals of proxy-issued certificates. Imported certificates now populate AKI/SKI and serial number so their ARI `certID` resolves.
- **Configurable trust store sync limit** — the maximum number of certificates fetched per sync is now adjustable from the Trust Store page instead of being hardcoded.

### Changed
- **Generic external-CA metadata for ACME proxy certificates** — certificates issued through the ACME proxy are stored with source `acme_client` and labelled with the external account name (e.g. Actalis, ZeroSSL) instead of the hardcoded "Let's Encrypt" identity. Proxy orders are pinned to their external CA account, and the ACME history view shows the account label with a new `acme_client` source filter.

### Security
- **ACME EAB HMAC keys encrypted at rest** — external account EAB secrets (`acme_client_accounts.eab_hmac_key` and the legacy `acme.client`/`acme.proxy` SystemConfig values) are now encrypted with the master key on write, transparently decrypted on read, and rewritten by migration 061 where encryption is enabled. Legacy plaintext values remain readable.

## [2.198] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- **SSO role mapping multi-match resolution is now formalized** — when several of a user's external groups match mapping entries, the highest-privilege role wins (admin > operator > auditor > viewer). Previously the result silently depended on the storage order of the mapping entries. Documented in the role mapping help text. (#221)

### Security
- **ACME proxy no longer echoes upstream failure details** — directory, nonce, order, authorization and challenge errors now return a generic message to the ACME client, with the diagnostic kept in the server log. A URL slug matching no enabled proxy endpoint returns 404 instead of a 500.
- **ACME proxy finalize fails closed** — an order bound to an owner is refused (403) when no requester identity can be derived from the verified JWS, instead of proceeding unbound.

### Fixed
- **SSO mapping editor row shuffling** — editing the external-group name of any row no longer reorders the list on every keystroke, and transiently typing a name that collides with another entry no longer destroys that entry. Rows now keep a stable identity while editing. (#222)
- **mTLS certificate PKCS12 export with encryption at rest enabled** — the export read the stored private key without decrypting it, so it failed whenever key encryption was active. An unusable stored key now returns a clear error instead of a generic server error.
- **dns-01 challenge TXT name for wildcard domains** — the wildcard prefix strip removed any leading run of `*` and `.` characters, producing a wrong `_acme-challenge` owner name for domains whose label started with a dot-adjacent wildcard form.
- **Certificate requests with an invalid CSR signature are now rejected** (400) instead of being accepted for issuance.
- **Revocation with a future `invalidity_date` is now rejected** (400) — RFC 5280 §5.3.2 defines it as a past compromise time (5 minutes of clock skew allowed).
- **Removing a certificate hold no longer leaves the certificate mis-staged** when the delta CRL `removeFromCRL` entry cannot be written; the failure is reported instead of silently continuing, and a failed delta emission no longer aborts the unhold.
- **EC curve names containing hyphens** (`ECDSA-P384`, `NIST P-521`) are now accepted wherever a curve can be specified.

## [2.197] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Named protocol URLs can be enabled on existing CAs** — the opt-in previously available only at CA creation can now be enabled afterwards from the CRL & OCSP page (or `PATCH /api/v2/cas/<id>` with `namedUrls`). Auto-generated CDP/AIA URLs are rewritten to the slug form and newly issued certificates embed it; already-issued certificates keep their refid URLs, which continue to resolve. Enabling remains irreversible. (#207)

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy `Link: rel="up"` header** — the authorization link returned on challenge responses doubled the `/acme/proxy` path segment, sending clients that re-poll their authorization (Traefik/lego) to a nonexistent URL. (#217)
- **ACME proxy certificate download latency** — DNS-01 TXT cleanup now runs in a background thread instead of blocking the certificate response on live DNS-provider API calls. (#218)
- **ACME proxy order lookup on certificate download** — the upstream certificate URL is now persisted on the proxy order when it first appears (finalize or order poll), so the download resolves its order with one indexed query instead of a live upstream round-trip per accumulated pending order. (#219)
- **ACME proxy no longer forwards the upstream `Link` header** — its `rel="alternate"` entries point directly at the real CA and cannot be authenticated by proxy clients; the preferred chain is already resolved server-side and served in the body. (#220)
- **CRL & OCSP details panel layout** — the "Full CRL Schedule" and "Delta CRL" blocks now render as framed sections, consistent with the rest of the panel.

## [2.196] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **ACME loopback upstream opt-in** — a new toggle (Let's Encrypt settings / `acme.client.allow_loopback_upstream`, default off) allows the ACME client and proxy to reach an upstream CA on a loopback address (a colocated Pebble/step-ca on 127.0.0.1). Cloud-metadata targets remain blocked unconditionally.

### Fixed
- **Security-key (WebAuthn) login restored** — after the per-user credential count was removed from `/auth/methods` (username-enumeration hardening), the login page stopped offering the security-key option and auto-attempt. The UI no longer depends on that count: it auto-attempts based on the device's saved method and always offers the security-key button when the browser supports it.
- **WebAuthn username-enumeration oracle closed** — `POST /auth/login/webauthn/start` returned a challenge only for users with a registered key (200) versus a 401 otherwise, and `/verify` used distinguishable errors. Both now return identical, well-formed responses for unknown, credential-less, and real users (a deterministic per-username decoy credential), removing the account-existence oracle.
- **No default `serverAuth` EKU on issuing CAs** — intermediate CAs created via the API without an explicit `extendedKeyUsage` were given a `serverAuth` EKU, which (via EKU chaining) invalidated clientAuth / emailProtection / OCSPSigning leafs issued beneath them, including delegated OCSP responders. Issuing CAs now have no EKU by default; constrain them explicitly via `extendedKeyUsage`.
- **ACME proxy serves the preferred certificate chain** — the per-account preferred chain was computed and stored but the upstream default chain was returned to the client; the selected chain is now the one delivered.
- **ACME proxy order ownership binding** — new-order and finalize now bind an order to the account resolved from the request `kid`, so a different account can no longer finalize someone else's order. The previous binding only took effect for JWK-signed requests, which RFC 8555 new-order/finalize never are.
- **ACME DNS-01 self-check is advisory** — a local resolver that cannot see the challenge TXT record (split-horizon or filtered egress DNS) no longer aborts renewal or proxy issuance before the challenge is submitted; the CA remains the authority. Set the propagation timeout to 0 to skip the pre-check entirely.
- **SAN URI validation** — the issuance/CSR forms now accept authority-less URIs (`urn:`, `mailto:`, `did:`), matching what the API already allowed.
- **Account page PKCS#12 labels** — two missing translation keys rendered as raw identifiers on the mTLS certificate export controls.
- **Signed CSR history panel** — clicking "View certificate" no longer throws a runtime error.
- **ACME auto-renewal toggle persistence** — the Let's Encrypt auto-renewal switch sent a field the API did not read, so the setting never saved; it now uses `renewal_enabled`.

### Translations
- Completed the ACME "verbose logs" label and description across all locales.

## [2.195] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Named protocol URLs per CA (opt-in)** — a CA created with `namedUrls` gets an immutable unique slug derived from its name, used instead of the random id in CDP/AIA URL paths (`/cdp/my-issuing-ca.crl`); both slug and refid forms always resolve. Easier manual configuration of CRL/OCSP paths in relying products; refid stays the default. Migration 060. (#207)
- **Full CRL schedule per CA** — CRL validity (`nextUpdate` window) decoupled from the publish cadence, with `next_publish` exposed in CRL metadata and the scheduler republishing on the configured interval; configurable CRL signature digest (SHA-256/384/512). New `GET|POST /api/v2/crl/<ca_id>/config`, CRL & OCSP page UI, migration 059. (#207)
- **Readable CRL download filename** — CDP downloads suggest `{ca-slug}-{refid8}.crl` via `Content-Disposition`; URLs are unchanged (they are embedded in issued certificates). (#207)
- **Clock-skew tolerance on issuance** — issued certificates backdate `notBefore` by a fixed 15 minutes so relying parties with slightly slow clocks accept fresh certificates; `notAfter` stays anchored on the requested validity. (#207)
- **Port 80 for protocol endpoints** — documented the supported ways to serve CDP/OCSP/AIA on port 80 (systemd `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, reverse proxy, Docker port mapping). (#207)

### Fixed
- **Template digest honored at issuance** — certificates issued from the certificate menu were always signed SHA-256 regardless of the template's configured digest; the template link (`template_id`) is now persisted on the issued row. (#207)
- **Template usage counter** — the templates list/detail now return a live `usage_count` computed from issued certificates (the UI previously displayed a field the API never provided). (#207)

## [2.194] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **CSR SKI/AKI injection** — Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier from a client CSR are no longer copied into the issued certificate. SKI is always derived from the subject public key; AKI always from the issuing CA's SKI (public-key fallback). Prevents enrollee-controlled key-identifier spoofing (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.1 / §4.2.1.2).
- **EE and intermediate AKI** — end-entity and intermediate certificates set AKI from the issuer certificate's SKI when present, matching CRL AKI behaviour.
- **CA AIA caIssuers** — intermediate CA certificates now include AIA `caIssuers` (and OCSP) from the parent CA when configured, mirroring the end-entity path (RFC 5280 §4.2.2.1).
- **CRL invalidityDate** — optional `invalidity_at` / API `invalidity_date` on revoke is emitted as CRL entry extension §5.3.2 (migration **058**).
- **Unhold + delta CRL** — lifting `certificateHold` emits a delta CRL entry with reason `removeFromCRL` when delta CRL is enabled, then regenerates the full CRL (§5.3.1).
- **CRL Authority Key Identifier (RFC 5280 §5.2.1)** — full and delta CRLs now set AKI from the issuing CA's Subject Key Identifier (with public-key fallback if SKI is absent), instead of copying the CA certificate's AKI (which points at the parent for intermediates). Clients that match CRL AKI to the signing CA SKI no longer reject intermediate CRLs. (#202)
- **CRL RFC 5280 profile follow-up** — omit `IssuingDistributionPoint` on delta CRLs so base+delta both omit IDP (§5.2.4); guard `FreshestCRL` so missing CDP no longer raises (§5.2.6); omit `unspecified` reasonCode and restrict `removeFromCRL` to delta CRLs (§5.3.1); shared AKI helper; accurate `revoked_count`.

### Tests
- Regression coverage for #202: intermediate full/delta CRL AKI≠parent, root CRL, SKI-missing fallback, and unauthenticated regenerate gates.
- RFC 5280 CRL profile suite: IDP parity, FreshestCRL, reasonCode, AKI smoke, auth gates, openssl lab text dump.
- Cert/CRL profile gaps suite: CSR SKI/AKI overwrite, CA AIA caIssuers, invalidityDate, unhold removeFromCRL, auth gates, openssl lab.
- Lab scripts: `scripts/lab_crl_openssl_verify.py`, `scripts/lab_rfc5280_cert_crl_profile.py`.

### Docs
- ADMIN_GUIDE / SECURITY / TESTING / API_REFERENCE updated for CRL profile, CSR SKI/AKI policy, and optional `invalidity_date`.

## [2.193] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- **WinRM admin channel dependencies bundled** — `pywinrm` and `requests-ntlm` are now part of the default requirements (pure-python wheels), so the Microsoft CA admin channel (revoke/unrevoke, CRL publish, inventory sync) works out of the box on Docker, DEB and RPM without a manual `pip install` — previously impossible in policy-restricted or air-gapped deployments. `requests-kerberos` stays optional (C-extension dependencies). (#159)

### Added
- **ACME preferred certificate chain** — per-account `preferred_chain` (trust-anchor CN, e.g. `ISRG Root X1`) selects an RFC 8555 `Link: rel="alternate"` chain during certificate download in the ACME client and proxy; matches last cert subject or issuer CN; alternate issuer chains are rebuilt with the primary leaf when intermediates differ; UI field on the multi-CA account manager. (#197)

### Fixed
- **SoftHSM token persistence in Docker Compose** — `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.simple.yml` now mount `ucm-hsm-tokens:/var/lib/softhsm/tokens` like `docker-compose.hsm.yml` already did. Without it, the token auto-initialized by the entrypoint was lost on container re-creation, orphaning the `SoftHSM-Default` provider row and any keys stored under it. (#195)
- **PKCS#11 config key normalization (#198)** — migration **057** rewrites legacy `library_path`/`pin` rows to `module_path`/`user_pin`; startup repair for existing SoftHSM-Default; runtime alias acceptance in `PKCS11Provider`. Extends #194.

### Security
- **ACME proxy post-directory SSRF** — upstream directory, nonce, and signed POST-as-GET calls now use DNS-pinned `safe_request_get` / `safe_request_head` / `safe_request_post` with `validate_url_not_cloud_metadata()`, matching the hardened ACME client path.

## [2.192] - 2026-07-11

### Security
- **`/api/v2/auth/methods` trusted-proxy gate** — the unauthenticated auth-method discovery endpoint re-parsed reverse-proxy `X-SSL-Client-*` headers without checking `is_request_from_trusted_proxy()`, so a remote caller who knew an enrolled certificate serial could learn the mapped UCM username (`mtls_user`) without a session. The endpoint now applies the same trusted-proxy gate as `login_mtls()`. (GHSA-p4hj-mmxv-xh65)
- **Legacy settings webhook test DNS rebinding** — `POST /api/v2/settings/webhooks/<id>/test` validated the URL once then called bare `requests.post()`, which re-resolved DNS and could reach cloud metadata or loopback despite the check. The test path now uses DNS-pinned `safe_request_post()`, matching the hardened `/api/v2/webhooks` delivery path. (GHSA-q7j8-h9jm-qxw8)
- **ACME multi-CA account directory SSRF** — creating or registering an external ACME CA account accepted any `https://` `directory_url` and fetched it with an unpinned HTTP client, allowing loopback/cloud-metadata targets despite the narrow SSRF guard used elsewhere. Account create/register now validates with `validate_url_not_cloud_metadata()` (RFC1918 internal CAs remain allowed) and directory fetch uses DNS-pinned `safe_request_get()` with the configured `acme.client.verify_ssl` setting preserved. (GHSA-5p92-5vpr-2x5w)
- **Smart import / OPNsense CA import permission gate** — CA (and private-key) ingestion now requires `write:cas`, matching `POST /api/v2/cas/import`. Smart import gates on parsed CA presence in the content (cert-only imports still work with `write:certificates` alone). (GHSA-rgcp-9wxj-6896)
- **Smart import CA gate bypass for legacy CA certs without BasicConstraints** — the `write:cas` gate classified CA material by `BasicConstraints CA:true` alone, so a legacy root that asserts `keyCertSign` in Key Usage but omits BasicConstraints was treated as a leaf and could be imported (and routed into the CA store) with `write:certificates` only. Import now treats a certificate as CA material when it has either `BasicConstraints CA:true` or `keyCertSign`, both for the permission gate and for CA-vs-leaf routing.
- **SAML IdP metadata fetch DNS rebinding** — `POST /api/v2/sso/saml/metadata/fetch` now uses DNS-pinned `safe_request_get()` instead of a bare `requests.get()` after one-shot SSRF validation. (GHSA-9crx-4487-wvxc)
- **Global search user PII scope** — `GET /api/v2/search` returns user email/role only when the caller holds `read:users`, aligning with `/api/v2/users`. (GHSA-4v84-cxgw-8g4g)
- **`/api/v2/auth/methods` username enumeration** — pre-authentication responses no longer expose per-user `mtls_certificates` counts that leak valid usernames (distinct from GHSA-p4hj header-forgery). (GHSA-xxhm-683g-fjj5)
- **ACME proxy EAB gate on new-order** — when `acme_eab_required` was enabled, `POST /acme/proxy/new-order` required both `jwk` and `kid` in the protected header, but RFC 8555 §6.2 makes them mutually exclusive, so every request was rejected (kid-authenticated orders failed with "Missing JWK"). The gate now requires `kid` (registered account) only.
- **ACME proxy concurrent cert/order mis-binding** — `get_certificate()` picked the newest pending proxy order instead of matching the upstream `certificate` URL, so concurrent orders could return the wrong certificate. Certificate download now resolves the order via upstream `certificate` URL; finalize also binds the requester JWK thumbprint when stored on the order.
- **ACME client post-directory SSRF** — after the initial directory fetch was pinned (GHSA-5p92), `_get_nonce()` and `_post()` still used unpinned `session.head()` / `session.post()` for URLs embedded in directory JSON, allowing DNS rebinding to loopback or cloud metadata. All ACME client outbound calls now validate with `validate_url_not_cloud_metadata()` and use DNS-pinned `safe_request_head()` / `safe_request_post()`.

### Added
- **Certificate list: filter by source** — the Certificates page has a new **Source** filter (multi-select) alongside status and issuer, to narrow the list by issuance origin: Manual, Import, Local ACME, Let's Encrypt, SCEP, EST, and Microsoft AD CS. Backed by `GET /api/v2/certificates?source=<...>` (repeatable for multi-select); legacy rows with no recorded source are matched under "Manual".
- **Public endpoints GUI — admin, protocol HTTP, and ACME vhost** — Settings → General → **Endpoints publics** to configure canonical admin URL (`base_url`), protocol HTTP base (`protocol_base_url`), and ACME public vhost with effective ports from `HTTPS_PORT` / `HTTP_PROTOCOL_PORT`. Includes dynamic CORS origins, **Utiliser l'URL du navigateur**, and **Vérifier DNS et TLS** preflight (local, corporate/internal via `UCM_CORPORATE_DNS_SERVERS`, and public resolvers) plus TCP/TLS reachability checks. Host middleware soft-redirects IP/alias hosts to the canonical admin origin, serves ACME paths on the split vhost only, and rejects untrusted `X-Forwarded-Host` when ProxyFix is enabled. API: `GET/PATCH/POST /api/v2/settings/public-endpoints`. Docs: `docs/testing/PUBLIC-ENDPOINTS.md`. (#186)
- **Microsoft AD CS: CA control panel — approve/deny pending requests and CA health (admin channel)** — the connection now surfaces a control panel (over the WinRM admin channel) to manage requests that are awaiting CA manager approval: list pending requests, approve them (`certutil -resubmit`, with the issued certificate imported into UCM automatically), or deny them (`certutil -deny`). It also shows a CA health snapshot — CA service status, CA certificate expiry, CRL next-update, and pending-request count — assembled from locale-neutral sources so it works regardless of the CA's display language. Pending listing and health need `read:certificates`; approve/deny need `admin:system`. Completes the CA management surface for #185; verified end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS (approve → issued → imported, deny → request marked denied on the CA). (#185)
- **Microsoft AD CS: CA inventory sync — import certificates issued directly on the CA (opt-in)** — building on the WinRM admin channel, UCM can now import certificates that were issued on the Windows CA outside UCM (native tools, autoenrollment, or before UCM was deployed), so it can track the whole certificate lifecycle rather than only what it issued itself. The sync reads the CA database with `certutil -view`, imports certificates UCM doesn't already have (deduplicated by serial), and is incremental by request id (with a full-rescan option). A reconciliation view lists certificates present on the CA but not in UCM, and UCM certificates for that connection absent from the CA. Runs every 6 hours for opted-in connections plus an on-demand "Import from CA" action; import needs `admin:system`, reconciliation needs `read:certificates`. Completes the CA inventory sync requested in #185; verified end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS. (#185)
- **Microsoft AD CS: WinRM admin channel — revoke, unrevoke and publish CRL on the CA (opt-in)** — a Microsoft CA connection can now carry an optional WinRM administration channel so UCM performs real management operations on the Windows CA (which AD CS Web Enrollment cannot do). Revoking an MS-CA-issued certificate in UCM now propagates the revocation to the CA (`certutil -revoke` + CRL publish); lifting a certificateHold propagates the unrevoke; and a "Publish CRL" action forces the CA to issue a fresh CRL. Auth is NTLM or Kerberos over HTTP/HTTPS (Kerberos+HTTPS recommended); credentials default to the connection's own, with optional override fields for a dedicated least-privilege "Issue and Manage Certificates" account (required for mTLS-enrolled connections, which have no reusable WinRM credential). Serial numbers are validated as hex and no user-supplied string reaches the remote shell. `pywinrm` is an optional dependency (lazy-imported; the rest of UCM and installs without AD CS never require it). Management operations require `admin:system`. Verified end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS (revocation in UCM confirmed as disposition "Revoked" in the CA database). (#185)
- **Microsoft AD CS: CRL-based revocation sync (opt-in)** — a Microsoft CA connection can now periodically fetch the CA's CRL and mark certificates revoked on the CA as revoked in UCM (strictly one-way, CA → UCM; certificates revoked locally in UCM are never un-revoked). The CRL URL is taken from the connection settings or auto-detected from the CRL Distribution Point of certificates issued by that CA, the CRL signature is verified against the CA certificate before anything is applied, and the revocation date/reason are taken from the CRL entry. Runs hourly for opted-in connections, plus a "Sync CRL now" button and `POST /api/v2/microsoft-cas/<id>/sync-crl`. First step of the CA inventory sync discussed in #185; verified end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS (revocation done with `certutil -revoke` on the CA propagated to UCM by the scheduled sync). (#185)

### Fixed
- **Microsoft AD CS: pending requests are now recognized on non-English CAs** — the `certsrv` client only matches the English "Certificate Pending" enrollment page, so against a localized AD CS (e.g. a French-language CA) a genuinely pending request was misreported as denied — signing returned a 400 — and polling a still-pending request failed with a 500. UCM now classifies the AD CS response using the locale-independent HTML markers certsrv itself emits (the `locInfoReqID` element id, and the numeric request disposition code where 5 = under submission and 2 = denied) instead of the translated text, so submit returns a proper "pending" status and polling keeps returning "pending" until the CA manager acts. Verified end-to-end against a French Windows Server 2025 AD CS. (#159)
- **Renewing a certificate issued by a Microsoft AD CS connection now goes through the connector** — renewal previously used the local re-sign path, which failed with "Issuing CA not found" (or "CA private key not available") because the issuing CA's key lives on the Windows CA. UCM now resubmits the certificate's original CSR (same key, subject and SANs) to the AD CS connection and template that issued it, and updates the certificate in place; if the CA holds the request for manager approval, the renewal is tracked like any pending MS CA request. EOBO-issued certificates require the same elevated permission to renew as to issue. Reported in #159. Verified end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS.

### Changed
- **Revoking a Microsoft-CA-issued certificate now states that the revocation is local to UCM** — AD CS Web Enrollment has no revocation endpoint, so UCM cannot propagate the revocation to the Windows CA. The API response and the revoke confirmation dialog now say so explicitly (`meta.msca_local_only` for API consumers) and remind you to revoke the certificate on the CA itself. Reported in #159.


## [2.191] - 2026-07-10

> ⚠️ **Upgrade note — LDAP/SSO certificate verification is now enforced.** Before this
> release, an LDAP/SSO provider with **"verify SSL" enabled but no CA bundle uploaded**
> silently performed **no** certificate validation. It now validates the LDAP server
> certificate against the system trust store. **Action required:** if your LDAP server
> uses a private or self-signed certificate that is not in the host's system trust store,
> upload its CA as the provider's CA bundle before upgrading, or those logins will start
> failing with a TLS validation error. Providers with "verify SSL = off" are unaffected.
> See #181.

### Security
- **LDAP TLS was not validated when "verify SSL" was on but no CA bundle was set** — with SSL verification enabled but no CA bundle uploaded, the LDAP/SSO TLS builder fell back to ldap3's default TLS, which does not validate the server certificate, so a "verify SSL = on" provider silently performed no verification (MITM exposure on LDAP auth). It now validates against the system trust store (`CERT_REQUIRED`). **Note:** verification is on by default — an LDAP server using a private/self-signed certificate that is not in the system trust store must now have its CA uploaded as the provider CA bundle (previously such setups connected without validation). Explicit "verify SSL = off" is unchanged. Contributed by @heidrickla (#181).
- **SSRF guard could be bypassed via unspecified and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses** — the outbound-URL guard (webhooks, SSO discovery, ACME proxy) checked loopback but not the unspecified address (`0.0.0.0` / `::`, which route to loopback on most systems), and matched the cloud-metadata deny-list by string, so an IPv4-mapped IPv6 encoding (e.g. `::ffff:169.254.169.254`) slipped past. The guard now collapses IPv4-mapped IPv6 to IPv4, compares against a parsed-IP deny-set, and treats unspecified addresses as forbidden. Contributed by @heidrickla (#182).
- **Outbound request hardening: default timeout + DNS-rebinding fix** — the SSRF-pinned request helpers sent no default `timeout`, so a stuck upstream could hang a worker indefinitely; they now default to 30s (overridable). The ACME proxy connection test validated the host and then fetched via `urllib.urlopen`, which re-resolved the hostname independently (DNS-rebinding window); it now fetches through the pinned SSRF-safe helper so resolution, deny-list re-validation, and the pinned connection all use the same IP. Contributed by @heidrickla (#183).

### Changed
- **SCEP crypto migrated off the unmaintained pyCrypto to pyca/cryptography** — the SCEP crypto helpers and message parser now use `cryptography`'s ciphers (AES-256-CBC, 3DES-CBC) instead of `pycryptodome`, which is dropped as a dependency. The algorithms are standard so ciphertext is byte-identical and existing SCEP clients' messages keep decrypting unchanged. Contributed by @heidrickla (#184).

### Fixed
- **SCEP auto-approve enrollment crashed on a naive/aware datetime comparison** — when clamping an issued certificate's validity to the CA's expiry, the code compared `utc_now()` (naive-UTC) against the CA certificate's timezone-aware expiry, raising `can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. The SCEP handler masked it as a generic failure, so every auto-approved enrollment failed with "Internal SCEP processing error" (the renewal validity-window check had the same flaw). Both comparisons are now done consistently, with a regression test that issues against an online CA. Verified end-to-end with a real SCEP client (enrollment now returns SUCCESS).
- **`api.v2` failed to import on non-POSIX platforms** — `api/v2/system/https.py` did an unconditional top-level `import pwd` (a Unix-only stdlib module), and since `api/v2/__init__.py` imports every submodule eagerly, the whole `api.v2` package (and the test suite) failed to import on Windows with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pwd'`. `pwd` is now imported lazily inside the two `chown` sites and skipped gracefully off POSIX; Linux behaviour is unchanged. Contributed by @heidrickla (#179).
- **Removed unreachable dead code in the backup service** — `BackupService._encrypt_private_key` had a `return` after its real `return`, dead code that would have leaked the plaintext key if ever reached. Contributed by @heidrickla (#180).


## [2.190] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **API-key creation rejected valid permission resources** — the permission validator in `POST /api/v2/account/apikeys` used a hardcoded resource list that had drifted from the scopes actually enforced by the API: keys could not be scoped to `csrs`, `user_certificates`, `templates`, `truststore`, `est`, `hsm`, `ssh`, `policies`, `approvals`, `key_recovery`, `audit`, `groups` or `sso` (e.g. `write:csrs`, required to sign a CSR, was rejected — leaving CSR signing reachable only with a full-access `*` key). The valid set is now derived from `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` plus the admin-only resources (`users`, `system`, `sso`), with a regression test that scans every `@require_auth` scope so the validator can no longer drift. Contributed by @heidrickla (#178).


## [2.189] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **ACME LOT A — shared DNS self-check for proxy and renewal** — the ACME proxy and auto-renewal paths no longer use a blind fixed 30s sleep after publishing the DNS-01 TXT record. Both now poll actively via `services/acme/dns_selfcheck.py`, honouring `acme.client.dns_propagation_timeout` (same setting as the ACME client auto-poll). If the TXT is still missing when the timeout elapses, the proxy skips upstream challenge submission and marks the challenge `dns_not_ready` instead of burning the token on the upstream CA. Renewal cleans up DNS TXT records on propagation or finalization failure.
- **ACME renewal partial TXT cleanup** — multi-domain renewals now mark DNS TXT records for cleanup as soon as the first `create_txt_record` succeeds, so a failure on a later domain no longer leaves earlier TXT records behind.
- **GUI toggle: verbose ACME/DNS diagnostics** — **ACME → Let's Encrypt → Verbose ACME/DNS logs** (`acme.client.debug_logging`) promotes DNS resolver diagnostics (poll ticks, per-resolver failures, lookup source) from DEBUG to INFO for troubleshooting propagation issues without raising the global log level. The flag is memoized per app context, so hot poll loops do not query the database per log line. Default off.

### Changed
- **ACME client DNS self-check refactor** — `_dns_selfcheck` / timeout reading in `orders.py` now delegate to the shared `dns_selfcheck` module used by proxy and renewal, keeping one implementation for poll interval, logging, and timeout semantics.

### Fixed
- **AD CS Kerberos authentication crashed on a missing unused dependency** — the kerberos auth mode built the certsrv client in NTLM mode before attaching the Kerberos handler, which made the certsrv library import `requests_ntlm` even though it was never used. Every Test Connection / sign in kerberos mode failed with "No module named 'requests_ntlm'". The client is now built with a neutral placeholder auth and the Kerberos handler attached directly; all three auth modes (basic, certificate/mTLS, kerberos) smoke-tested end-to-end against a Windows Server 2025 AD CS.

## [2.188] - 2026-07-08

### Security
- **DNS provider credentials encrypted at rest (GHSA-38cv-3c4g-w55w)** — DNS-01 provider API keys/tokens (Cloudflare, Route53, …) were stored as plaintext JSON in `dns_providers.credentials` despite the column being labelled encrypted, so anyone with database read access (or a raw export of the field) obtained domain-control credentials. The field is now encrypted at rest via a model property (utils.encryption Fernet, mirroring the EAB HMAC key), read paths transparently decrypt (legacy plaintext rows still read), and migration `052` encrypts any pre-existing rows. Backup export/restore round-trips the decrypted value so cross-machine restore keeps working; regression tested (round-trip, at-rest ciphertext, constructor/restore path, migration idempotency). Reported externally by Ralph.
- **Dev-dependency advisories** — bumped transitive build/lint tooling out of vulnerable ranges via npm overrides: `js-yaml` → 4.3.0 (GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68, quadratic-complexity DoS in merge-key handling; pulled in by eslint) and `@babel/core` → 7.29.7 (GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8, arbitrary file read via `sourceMappingURL`; pulled in by @vitejs/plugin-react). Both are build-time only and never shipped in the runtime bundle.


## [2.187] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Configurable public vhost for ACME directory URLs** — a dedicated public hostname/port (`acme_public_vhost`, `acme_public_port` in Settings → General) can now be advertised in the local ACME server and ACME proxy directory URLs (`/acme/*`, `/acme/proxy/*`), independent of the admin UI URL — the split admin/ACME reverse-proxy topology (e.g. `admin.ucm.example.com` vs `acme.ucm.example.com` behind one wildcard certificate). JWS verification accepts both the advertised public origin and the inbound URL; without a configured vhost, behavior is unchanged (request host). Wildcard hostnames are rejected for the vhost value (TLS SAN concept, not an advertised URL), and an optional `acme_public_tls_cert_id` records which managed certificate to deploy on the ACME vhost (metadata only). Settings APIs expose `acme_public_base_url` / `acme_proxy_public_base_url` and the UI directory URLs follow the configured origin (#173, thanks @fredlubrano).

### Changed
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Session.get`** — all 353 `Model.query.get()` / `query.get_or_404()` call sites migrated to `db.session.get()` / `db.get_or_404()`, eliminating ~4500 `LegacyAPIWarning` per test run ahead of a future SQLAlchemy major bump.

### Security
- **CSR extension policy on certificate issuance** — the shared CSR signer copied every requested extension into the issued certificate verbatim, so a crafted CSR carrying `BasicConstraints CA:true` (and `keyCertSign`) submitted through EST, SCEP or ACME enrollment could obtain a working subordinate CA — a trust escalation from an enrollment endpoint. Leaf certificate types now force `BasicConstraints(ca=False)` and strip the CA-only key-usage bits; only the explicit intermediate-CA signing flow may assert CA powers. Regression tested.
- **SCEP unauthenticated auto-enrollment when no challenge is set** — per RFC 8894 §2.4 an omitted `challengePassword` allows unauthenticated authorisation, so with auto-approve enabled and no challenge configured any anonymous client on the public SCEP endpoint received a CA-signed certificate. Initial `PKCSReq` auto-issuance is now refused unless a challenge is configured (manual-approval mode and renewals are unaffected); `UCM_SCEP_ALLOW_NO_CHALLENGE=1` opts back in for isolated deployments.
- **Key-strength floor on EST and SCEP enrollment** — both protocols now reject CSRs whose public key is below policy (RSA < 2048, non-NIST EC curves) instead of signing weak/exotic keys, matching the UI/API issuance floor (EST RFC 7030 §3.7 and SCEP defer key policy to the local CA).
- **EST request-body cap bypass via chunked encoding** — the body-size limit only inspected `Content-Length`, so a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request could stream an unbounded body into memory. The body is now read with a hard cap on the request stream regardless of framing.

### Fixed
- **Broken settings restore endpoint** — `POST /api/v2/settings/backup/restore` passed a temp-file path where the service expects raw bytes, so it returned 500 on every call and left the uploaded (encrypted) backup in `/tmp` on each attempt. It now reads the upload as size-capped bytes in memory (no temp file) and restores correctly.
- **mTLS certificate import always failed** — `POST /api/v2/mtls/enroll-import` crashed on every valid PEM (undefined variable, then a str stored into the binary `cert_pem` column). The endpoint now imports and enrolls correctly; covered by a regression test.
- **Public ACME vhost hardening (post-#173 review)** — the local ACME server now accepts the JWS `url` on both the advertised public origin and the inbound request origin (the tolerance moved into `verify_jws` itself, shared with the proxy, so in-flight orders survive an `acme_public_vhost` change on `/acme/*` too); CAA enforcement and `caaIdentities` follow the configured public hostname instead of the inbound `Host`; the vhost is validated as a real FQDN (rejects `..`, leading/trailing hyphens, single labels); non-string vhost values and out-of-band garbage port rows return 400/defaults instead of 500; the public origin is memoized per request (one combined SystemConfig read instead of up to 10 per proxy request); the TLS certificate is picked from a dropdown of key-bearing certificates instead of a raw database id, and clearing it removes the config row; the CA Accounts panel shows the same public directory URLs as the other tabs.


## [2.186] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy `/directory` on fresh install** — the legacy `/acme/proxy/directory` and `/new-nonce` endpoints returned a 500 (`No external ACME CA account configured for the proxy`) on a brand-new instance before any external CA account was added, because the proxy service resolved the upstream `AcmeClientAccount` eagerly in its constructor. Resolution is now lazy: only the upstream directory URL (config-derived, defaults to Let's Encrypt staging) is needed for `/directory` and `/new-nonce`, and the account row is looked up on the first key-bearing operation (`new-account`, `new-order`, signing), preserving the helpful configuration error for actual signing paths. This had broken the release smoke gate on a fresh Docker container.
- **ACME manual verify DNS wait and authorization poll cadence** — the synchronous manual-verify endpoint ran the DNS self-check up to the full configured `dns_propagation_timeout` (max 3600 s), risking client/proxy timeouts; it is now capped at 30 s (background auto-poll still honors the full timeout). The auto-poll loop also queried per-domain authorization status on every iteration, doubling CA traffic; it is now checked every `max(poll_interval × 5, 15)` s, with the order-status poll still catching terminal `invalid` states each interval.
- **Contact-less upstream account registration** — `AcmeClientService.register_account` now accepts `email=None` and omits the `contact` field (RFC 8555 makes it optional; Let's Encrypt accepts contact-less registrations), so the proxy no longer blocks issuance when the only available email has a non-public TLD (`.lan`/`.local`).
- **ACME preflight staging order cleanup on failure** — an ephemeral staging order created during a `full` preflight is now removed from the database even when a later stage of the preflight raises, instead of leaking an orphan row.
- **Key-reuse renewal fallback** — `key_source=reuse` now falls back to the original `source_certificate_id` when the order's own `certificate_id` is missing (e.g. an order whose import failed), so the key-reuse chain survives across renewals.


## [2.185] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **ACME proxy multi-CA with per-account slug endpoints** — the ACME proxy upstream is now selected per external CA account (`AcmeClientAccount`), so several CAs (Let's Encrypt staging, production, ZeroSSL, …) can be exposed in parallel. Each account can opt in to the proxy with a unique slug, served at `/acme/proxy/<slug>/directory` alongside the legacy `/acme/proxy/directory` (backward compatible). Reserved slugs (`directory`, `new-order`, `acct`, `challenge`, …) prevent collisions with existing routes. Migrations `050` (`acme.proxy.acme_account_id`) and `051` (`proxy_enabled`, `proxy_slug`) backfill the account already linked in proxy settings. The UI surfaces a toggle and slug field on external CA accounts and lists all enabled endpoints with a Certbot example (#170).
- **Typed SAN validation for certificate issuance** — the Issue Certificate form (`POST /api/v2/certificates`) now validates SAN entries per type (DNS, IP, Email, URI, UPN) on both backend and frontend, with cross-type errors (e.g. an FQDN entered in the IP field is rejected with a hint to use DNS) and ECDSA curve mapping (256/384/521 → `prime256v1`/`secp384r1`/`secp521r1`). The CN auto-SAN no longer adds an email CN as a DNS SAN on server certs; email SAN is added only for Email/Combined types. New RSA 3072 size and P-384/P-521 curve options appear in the Issue Certificate selector (#169).
- **CI: block bot Co-authored-by trailers** — a new `no-bot-attribution.yml` workflow rejects PRs whose commits carry `Co-authored-by` trailers from known AI agent identities (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, …), so commits attributed to bots can no longer reach `dev`.

### Fixed
- **ACME DNS-01 propagation diagnostics and `dns_propagation_timeout=0`** — the DNS-01 self-check succeeds as soon as the authoritative (or configured) resolver confirms the TXT record, but the per-public-resolver diagnostic log was emitted even on success and a flaky resolver (e.g. SERVFAIL from Quad9) was indistinguishable from a real propagation gap. Each failing public resolver is now logged at DEBUG with its exception type (`NXDOMAIN` / `Timeout` / `ConnectionError` / …) and the public-propagation line is explicitly marked `(diagnostic, does not block issuance)`. `dns_propagation_timeout=0` now skips the pre-check entirely on both the auto-poll background path and the manual Verify path (was a single-pass probe), matching the "submit immediately" help text (#171).
- **TXT RDATA multi-string concatenation** — long ACME authorization tokens published as a single TXT RR carrying several `<character-string>` elements (RFC 1035 §3.3.14; Quad9 splits them across quoted strings) are now joined before matching against the expected value. A correctly published record no longer renders as `value_mismatch` / `pending` on such a resolver (#171).
- **Migration 050 NotNullViolation on PostgreSQL** — the proxy account backfill inserted legacy credentials into `acme_client_accounts` without `created_at`/`updated_at`; on instances where those columns are `NOT NULL` without a server `DEFAULT`, the raw INSERT failed at boot (`null value in column "created_at"`). The migration now provides both timestamps explicitly on the SQLite and PostgreSQL paths.
- **Flaky OCSP/CDP auto-URL tests** — CA OCSP/CDP/AIA auto-URL generation relied on `hostname -f` via `_get_fqdn()`, which on CI runners can return a short hostname without a domain and resolve to `None`, flaking the update-CA tests. The shared test app fixture now pins `FQDN = 'ucm.test'` so URL generation is deterministic.


## [2.184] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Configurable RFC 5280 CA profile** — the Create CA wizard exposes signature digest (Auto aligns P-384 to SHA-384 and P-521 to SHA-512, or explicit SHA-256/384/512) and an expandable Certificate Profile section with Key Usage and Extended Key Usage. Roots default to `keyCertSign` + `cRLSign` (no `digitalSignature`) and no EKU; issuing CAs add `digitalSignature` and optional `serverAuth`, matching common enterprise root/intermediate profiles (Let's Encrypt Root-YR / issuing CA style). Intermediate CA `notAfter` is clamped to the parent CA expiry, and `GET /api/v2/cas/:id` now returns the X.509 serial number (colon-separated hex) and SHA-1/SHA-256 thumbprints. The obsolete Create CA help step about optional template selection (templates removed in migration 017) has been removed (#160).
- **ACME external CSR and renewal key reuse** — the ACME request form now offers a Key Source selector: Generate new key (default), Reuse key on renewal (preserves the same private key across renewals for DANE/TLSA and key pinning; first issuance generates a key, renewals reload it), or Provide external CSR (paste a PEM CSR; UCM submits it at ACME finalize, the private key never enters UCM). CSR domains are validated against the order identifiers (case-insensitive, RFC 4343). Auto-renewal honours the selected key source. Migration `049` adds `key_source`, `csr_pem` and `source_certificate_id` on `acme_client_orders` (#161).
- **ACME staging preflight dry-run** — a Run Preflight action on the ACME request form validates domains, contact email, ACME account/EAB, CA connectivity and DNS-01 challenge setup against the Let's Encrypt staging directory without consuming production rate limits or changing the global environment. Two modes: Full (staging order + required DNS TXT records preview) and Validate only (config + connectivity). For manual DNS providers it displays the exact `_acme-challenge` TXT records to add, with optional DNS propagation verification. Emits an `acme.preflight` webhook event and an `acme_preflight` audit entry (#162).
- **Typed SAN validation for CSR creation** — SAN entries are now validated per type (DNS, IP, Email, URI, UPN) on both backend and frontend, with clear cross-type errors (e.g. an FQDN entered in the IP field is rejected with a hint to use DNS). The frontend validation mirrors the backend rules so the client and server stay consistent (#167).
- **NIST P-521 EC curve option and normalized EC key labels** — Generate CSR and Create CA now accept NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 (ECDSA) key types through normalized labels (`EC P-256`, `NIST P-384`, `secp256r1`, `prime256v1`, …) that map to the OpenSSL curve names used internally. Previously `EC P-256` failed because the UI label was stripped to `P-256` and validated against OpenSSL curve names. The `secp256k1` (Koblitz) curve remains intentionally unsupported (#167).
- **Hex serial number in certificate technical details** — the certificate details view shows the serial as colon-separated uppercase hex (browser/OpenSSL display style) alongside the decimal form, copyable. Conversion handles decimal, `0x`-prefixed and compact/colon hex inputs and supports serials larger than 159 bits via arbitrary-precision integer math.

### Fixed
- **API key permission escalation** — a non-admin user with permission to create API keys (`POST /api/v2/account/apikeys`) could mint a key carrying permissions their own role did not hold (e.g. a viewer granting `admin:system`). The create path now rejects any permission the creator does not have, with the same wildcard semantics as the auth checker. Sharing a wildcard key (`*`) requires the creator to be an admin (#163).
- **Forged mTLS enrollment via spoofed proxy headers** — `POST /api/v2/mtls/enroll` honored `X-SSL-Client-Verify`, `X-SSL-Client-S-DN` and `X-SSL-Client-Cert` headers from any peer, so a caller who could reach gunicorn directly could forge a client certificate and enroll it as another user. The endpoint now gates on `is_request_from_trusted_proxy()` for those headers, matching the existing protection on the `login_mtls()` path (#163).


## [2.183] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Operator-configurable HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) header** — the HSTS policy was previously hardcoded to `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` on every HTTPS response. Instances serving self-signed certificates during initial setup can now opt out entirely, drop the `includeSubDomains` directive, or shorten `max-age` from Settings → Security. The setting can also be forced via `UCM_HSTS_ENABLED`, `UCM_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` and `UCM_HSTS_MAX_AGE` environment variables in `/etc/ucm/ucm.env` (takes precedence over the database); when set, the corresponding toggle in the UI is locked with a badge (#154).
- **mTLS PKCS#12 export from Account** — after generating an mTLS certificate from the Account page, both PEM and PKCS#12 (.p12) download are now offered client-side, with password-protected PKCS#12 for browser or OS keychain import. The download endpoint enforces POST with a JSON body for PKCS#12 (password never sent via query string, avoiding leakage in proxy logs), minimum 8-character password, and returns the `AuthCertificate` id usable by list/download/export (#156).

### Fixed
- **WebSocket handshake fails when if HTTPS_PORT was set to 443** - `CORS_ORIGINS` always appended `:{HTTPS_PORT}` to every allowed origin, so on port 443 the list contained entries such as `https://ucm.example.com:443`. Browsers omit the port number from the `Origin` header when it is the scheme default so it would never match. As Socket.IO performs server-side checks on `Origin`, WebSocket connections would be silently rejected. `CORS_ORIGINS` now omits the port suffix when `HTTPS_PORT` is 443 (#155).
- **SSH setup script command injection via hostname** — the public `GET /ssh/setup/<refid>` endpoint accepted arbitrary `hostname` query values that were embedded into generated shell/PowerShell scripts without validation. A payload such as `$(id)` or `";id;"` would execute when an operator piped the script to bash. Hostnames are now validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$` via a shared helper on both the public and authenticated setup routes, and the Windows script generator escapes single quotes (#157).


## [2.182] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Per-CA ACME timing settings and robust DNS-01 TXT verification** — each external ACME CA account now carries its own order poll timeout, poll interval and HTTP timeout (migration `048` adds `acme_client_accounts.order_poll_timeout_sec`, `order_poll_interval_sec`, `http_timeout_sec`), so a slow authority no longer inherits the global hardcoded values. The DNS-01 challenge self-check now resolves the expected TXT record through the authoritative nameservers first, then public resolvers, with per-resolver diagnostic logging, and invalid ACME authorizations are detected during polling instead of stalling until timeout. The Gandi DNS provider was also hardened (URL-encoding of record values, post-create verification, missing `Any` import) (#150).

### Fixed
- **ACME auto-renewal no longer crashes when refreshing the order expiry** — the renewal service read `new_cert.not_after` to copy the new certificate's expiry onto the order's `expires_at`, but the `Certificate` model exposes that date as `valid_to`. The `AttributeError` aborted the renewal right after the new certificate had been issued and imported, so `expires_at` was never updated and the scheduler re-requested the same certificate on every tick. The renewal path now reads `valid_to`, and `expires_at` is updated correctly so a renewed certificate is not renewed again until its next due window.

### Added
- **Multi-CA management for the ACME client** — UCM can now issue certificates from several external ACME authorities (Let's Encrypt, Actalis, ZeroSSL, Google Trust Services, HARICA…) instead of a single one. ACME CA accounts are managed from the UI (CRUD, per-account External Account Binding, default selection, registration status), each certificate request picks its issuing CA, and the order is pinned to that account so renewals stay on the same authority. The `AcmeClientOrder.acme_client_account_id` foreign key (migration `047`) links each order to its external CA account; `AcmeClientService.for_issuance(environment, account_id=)` resolves explicit account > configured custom directory > Let's Encrypt environment, and `for_order(order)` reuses the pinned account on verify/finalize/status/renewal (#149).


## [2.180] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Custom ACME CA directory and EAB are now honored for issuance and renewal** — when a custom ACME directory URL was configured in Settings → ACME client (e.g. Actalis, ZeroSSL, Google Trust Services) together with External Account Binding credentials, certificate issuance and renewal still went to Let's Encrypt instead of the configured CA. The custom directory and the EAB persisted in `SystemConfig` were never used by the issuance/renewal path; `acme.client.directory_url` was effectively dead for issuance. A new `AcmeClientService.for_issuance()` factory reads the configured custom directory (over the Let's Encrypt staging/production mapping) and backfills legacy EAB from `SystemConfig` onto the `AcmeClientAccount` row, and `for_order()` resolves the issuing account from the order's recorded `account_url` so an order keeps its CA across changes to the directory setting. All issuance, verify, finalize, status, auto-poll and renewal entry points now route through these factories (#147).


## [2.179] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Dashboard could not be scrolled on smaller desktop viewports** — on laptops where the sidebar narrowed the grid below the large breakpoint, the dashboard rendered a non-scrollable multi-row grid clipped inside a fixed-height container, so the lower widgets (Recent Activity, System Health, ACME Accounts, Trust Store) were unreachable. The grid container now scrolls vertically when the layout overflows instead of being clipped (#144).
- **Certificate linting no longer spawns a cascade of error toasts** — the conformance-lint modal (`CertificateLintModal`) retriggered its own fetch in a loop whenever a lint call failed, because the toast-dispatch callbacks it depended on were recreated on every render. Toast / notification callbacks are now stable, and the modal guards against concurrent lint calls, so a failed lint surfaces a single error instead of an unbounded stack (#145).

### Added
- **Downloadable diagnostic log bundle** — Settings → About → Diagnostic exposes an admin-only button that downloads a ZIP of the most relevant logs (`ucm.log`, `error.log`, `access.log`, the last lines of the systemd journal when available) plus a short secret-free system diagnostic (version, DB backend, migration number, services status). Sensitive tokens (Bearer credentials, passwords, API tokens, JWTs, PEM private-key blocks) are redacted before packaging, and each log file is capped so the bundle stays lightweight.


## [2.178] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **OCSP responder now echoes the request CertID hash algorithm** — the OCSP responder previously always built the `SingleResponse` CertID with SHA-256, regardless of the hash algorithm used in the request. Strict RFC 6960 clients (notably Cisco ASA) send a SHA-1 CertID and reject a response whose CertID they cannot match back to their request, causing OCSP validation to fail despite a valid `good` status. The responder now uses the request's hash algorithm (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) and recomputes the issuer name/key hashes accordingly, and the response cache is keyed per hash algorithm to avoid cross-algorithm cache collisions (#143).


## [2.177] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- **HSM-backed CA certificate issuance** — issuing, renewing, bulk-reissuing, or approval-flow issuing a certificate against an HSM-backed CA (Vault Transit / OpenBao / PKCS#11 / Azure Key Vault / GCP KMS) no longer fails with `CA private key not available`. Every certificate-issuance path now goes through the HSM-aware `get_ca_signing_key` loader instead of reading the local `ca.prv` column (which is empty for HSM CAs), and gates on `has_private_key` rather than on `ca.prv` (#142).
- **EST and auto-renewal signing** — `sign_csr_from_crypto` (the EST enrollment and automatic-renewal signing path) was loading the CA key directly from `ca.prv` and crashed on HSM-backed CAs; it now routes through the same HSM key loader as the rest of the codebase (#142).
- **SCEP with HSM-backed CAs** — the SCEP factory no longer crashes when the configured CA is HSM-backed. SCEP requires RSA envelope decryption (RFC 8894 §3.4), which is not available for HSM-resident keys, so the service now returns a clear `SCEP is not supported for HSM-backed CAs` error at configuration time instead of failing opaquely at runtime (#142).

### Changed
- **Dead code removed** — the unused `CAOperationsMixin.generate_crl` implementation (all callers use `CRLService.generate_crl`, which is already HSM-aware) and the orphaned `get_ca_private_key_pem` helper have been removed.


## [2.176] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Forced 2FA enrolment** — local and SSO logins can be required to enrol a TOTP authenticator before the session is fully usable. A restricted session is established until enrolment is complete (only the 2FA enrolment and logout endpoints are reachable). Global enforcement is a single *Enforce Two-Factor Authentication* toggle for local accounts; each SSO provider has its own `enforce_2fa` switch, independent of the global one. Individual users can be exempted (e.g., a break-glass admin). mTLS and WebAuthn logins are never additionally forced, since they are already a strong second factor (#141).


## [2.175] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Manual DNS-01 is usable again** — the ACME client no longer waits a fixed 10s then auto-submits. For a **Manual** DNS provider the order stays pending so you can add the TXT record and click **Verify Challenge** (which self-checks DNS before submitting, so it never burns the token; a force option bypasses the check). For **automated** providers the client self-checks propagation (configurable *DNS propagation timeout* in ACME → Let's Encrypt settings) and runs validation in the background so the request never blocks (#140).

### Fixed
- **Duplicate webhook notifications** — `certificate.expiring` (and other events) could be delivered twice with an identical payload while the delivery log showed a single event. Webhook deliveries are now claimed atomically (exactly-once) and the background scheduler runs in a single process, so each delivery is sent once even under concurrent workers (#139).

### Security
- Updated `cryptography` to 48.0.1 (GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf, vulnerable OpenSSL in wheels) and forced `ws` to 8.21.0 (CVE-2026-48779, WebSocket DoS).


## [2.173] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **SSO identity is now the directory's stable identifier**, never the email — OIDC `sub`, SAML persistent `NameID`, or LDAP `entryUUID`/`objectGUID` (configurable per provider, auto-detected by default). Accounts are recognised across username/email changes, and the email is never an authentication key (removes account-takeover risk). An SSO login whose email matches a local account now provisions a separate SSO account instead of erroring; an administrator can still merge them via *Link to SSO*, which no longer renames the local username (#136, #138).
- **Backups** — the backup list is paginated, searchable and sortable, with multi-select bulk delete, a usage summary (count, total size, free disk) and a *Clean up now* action. Retention is always visible (no longer hidden behind the automatic-backup toggle) and is enforced daily even when automatic backups are off.

### Fixed
- **Backups could fill the disk** — pre-migration database snapshots are now capped to the most recent few, and backup retention runs as its own scheduled task (previously it only ran after a scheduled backup, so manual backups accumulated indefinitely).


## [2.172] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **SSO login with an email that already exists** — an SSO (LDAP/OAuth2/SAML) login whose email matches an existing account no longer returns an Internal Server Error. Instead of silently merging on email (an account-takeover risk) or creating a duplicate, the login is refused with a clear message, and an administrator can deliberately link the two from Users › *Link to SSO* (new `link-sso`/`unlink-sso` actions). One account per email is preserved (#136).
- **Key-recovery dual control is now configurable** — a Settings › Security toggle enables/disables four-eyes control for private-key recovery, and `KEY_RECOVERY_DUAL_CONTROL` in the service environment overrides it (an explicit `false`/`0`/`no` disables it, and the toggle is shown read-only). Previously the setting could not be changed from the UI and the environment value was ignored (#137).


## [2.171] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Key archival & recovery** — a dual-control workflow to recover an archived private key: request (with reason) → admin approve (four-eyes; the approver must differ from the requester, configurable) → download as PKCS#12, once, fully audited. New Governance → Key Recovery page and a per-certificate "Recover key" action. Migration 042 (`key_recovery_requests`).
- **Code-signing EKUs** — the Extra-EKU picker now ships the well-known code-signing key purposes (Authenticode individual/commercial, lifetime signing, Windows kernel-mode, macOS code signing / Developer ID Application) on top of the base `codeSigning` EKU, for issuing Windows/JAR/macOS code-signing certificates. New [Code Signing](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/wiki/Code-Signing) wiki guide.
- **Helm chart** — `charts/ucm/` packages UCM for in-cluster deployment (Deployment, Service, Ingress, PVCs, generated/persisted secrets). Single-instance by design; persistent `/etc/ucm` master.key volume (retained on uninstall); SQLite by default or an external PostgreSQL via `database.databaseUrl`.

## [2.170] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Certificate conformance linting** — a per-certificate "Lint" action runs the certificate through standards linters (pkilint, plus zlint when available) and shows structured findings, with selectable RFC 5280 and CA/Browser Forum profiles. Informative only; pkilint is an optional dependency and the feature degrades gracefully when it is absent.
- **ACME Renewal Information (ARI)** — the ACME server now advertises and serves a `renewalInfo` resource (RFC 9773), returning a per-certificate suggested renewal window so clients can spread renewals and react immediately to revocation.
- **Prometheus metrics** — opt-in, bearer-gated `/metrics` endpoint exposing certificate, CA, scheduler, webhook and ACME counters in Prometheus exposition format, configurable from Settings › General (generate/rotate/disable the token).
- **Webhook delivery history** — per-endpoint delivery log with status, attempts and manual retry, backed by a durable async delivery queue with exponential backoff.
- **Scheduler admin view** — Settings › System now lists background tasks with their status, last run and a run-now action.
- **Scheduled backups** — automatic encrypted backups on a configurable cadence with retention.
- **In-app help** — contextual help panels and guides now cover the new features (linting, ARI, metrics, webhook delivery history, scheduler, scheduled backups) in every supported language.

### Fixed
- **Pagination** — list pages that paginated client-side (Users, Templates, SCEP, SSH CAs, CRL/OCSP, CSRs, ACME accounts, Discovery) now correctly page through their rows instead of rendering the full list on one page.
- **Layout** — list tables and toolbars no longer overflow into a horizontal scrollbar in split view, modals no longer show a double scrollbar, and the CA "columns" view wraps to fill the width instead of scrolling sideways.
- **Lifecycle events** — issuing, renewing or revoking a certificate (or creating/updating a CA) no longer risks an intermittent error when a webhook endpoint is configured, which could previously surface as a 500.

### Changed
- **Notifications** — email and WebSocket notifications are now fanned out through an in-process event bus, removing duplicated call-sites.

## [2.169] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Syslog source field** — remote syslog messages now populate the RFC 5424 HOSTNAME field from the configured System Name (falling back to the machine hostname), so audit events are attributable in log aggregators (#135).

### Fixed
- **LDAP required groups** — the required-groups restriction now saves correctly and is enforced at login; group matching is case-insensitive and previously stored values are repaired automatically (#133).
- **ACME IP certificates** — IP-only orders now honor the configured default issuing CA instead of falling back to the first available CA (#134).

### Security
- **ACME server** — settled challenges (valid/invalid) are no longer re-validated when re-submitted, and key rollover now rejects a key already bound to another account (keyConflict, RFC 8555).
- **Syslog** — structured-data values and message text are escaped/sanitized (RFC 5424), preventing log injection via certificate or user fields.
- **Email** — subjects and recipients are stripped of CR/LF to prevent SMTP header injection.
- **DNS providers** — provider error logs no longer leak API tokens that are transmitted as URL parameters.
- **Filesystem** — private-key and database-backup directories are tightened to owner-only permissions at startup.
- **Audit** — security-alert and audit events now record the real client IP when behind a trusted reverse proxy.

### Changed
- **Outbound services** — webhook, email, and Microsoft CA connectors hardened against partial failures, socket leaks, and logging errors.

## [2.168] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **User deletion** — the delete endpoint now permanently removes the account (with full FK cleanup: sessions, WebAuthn, mTLS certs, SSO sessions, API keys, group memberships) instead of only disabling it. Blocks deletion when pending approval requests exist; audit history is preserved (#132).

## [2.167] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **ACME IP address certificates (RFC 8738)** — the local ACME server can issue certificates for IPv4 and IPv6 identifiers. Only HTTP-01 and TLS-ALPN-01 are offered (DNS-01 is excluded per spec); TLS-ALPN-01 uses the reverse-DNS form as SNI; the issued certificate carries an `iPAddress` SAN; mixed DNS + IP orders are supported (#131).
- **LDAP required groups & disabled-account handling** — restrict SSO/LDAP login to members of configured required groups, reject disabled accounts, plus login hardening (#129).

### Fixed
- **ACME HTTP-01 for IPv6** — bracket IPv6 literals in challenge URLs per RFC 3986 (previously `InvalidURL`).
- **Rate limiter** — exempt RFC1918/loopback/link-local peers from the per-endpoint login limits, matching the global LAN-trust bypass; brute-force protection remains enforced via account lockout.
- **In-app help** — corrected ACME help section ordering across all locales and documented IP-certificate support.

### Changed
- **CI** — GitHub Actions bumped to Node 24 runtimes.

## [2.166] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **ACME ToS XSS** — HTML-escape terms of service content before rendering in React (#125).
- **Password policy bypass** — removed hardcoded `len < 8` check that could be bypassed with custom policy; policy enforcement now uses the full `validate_password()` result.
- **Migration transaction** — explicit `rollback()` after FK disable failure prevents `InFailedSqlTransaction` poison in psycopg2 connections.
- **Netcup DNS** — multi-part TLD support in `_split_domain_and_host` (e.g. `co.uk`).
- **Policy config cache** — `@lru_cache` on policy config to avoid repeated DB reads; removed dead code from legacy password checks.
- **ACME EAB** — proper notes field on EAB credentials, persisted in DB.
- **Auto-renewal** — fixed source validation (whitelist check) preventing valid sources from being rejected.
- **ExportDropdown** — hardcoded English strings replaced with `t()` interpolation (all 9 locales synced).

## [2.165] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **ACME DNS-01 auto-poll** — after TXT record creation, automatically wait for DNS propagation (30s), submit challenges, poll ACME status every 5s, and auto-finalize when order is ready (#127).

### Fixed
- **Database migration** — rollback connection after FK disable failure to prevent `InFailedSqlTransaction` when non-superuser runs SQLite → PostgreSQL migration (#126).
- **SSH CA setup script** — remove backslash-quotes from `CA_PUB_KEY` template that caused bash to execute the key as a command (`not found`) (#125).
- **Password complexity error** — `validate_password()` returns `List[dict]` but callers were passing the raw dict to `error_response()`, displaying `[object Object]` in the UI (#128).
- **SSH CA setup** — strip newlines from public key before embedding in shell script.
- **ACME DNS** — Netcup read-modify-write + nested subdomain resolution; Cloudflare scoped token `test_connection` fix.

## [2.164] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Netcup DNS** — read-modify-write on `create_txt_record` (no more zone overwrite), nested subdomain resolution (`_split_domain_and_host`), deletion uses internal record IDs.
- **Cloudflare DNS** — `test_connection()` uses zone-scoped `/zones?per_page=1` instead of `/user/tokens/verify` (fixes false-positive with scoped API tokens).

## [2.163] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- **ACME Terms of Service** (#120 point 4) — `GET /acme/terms` public endpoint returns HTML-rendered ToS (RFC 8555 §7.1.1). Settings API (`GET/PATCH /api/v2/acme/settings`) manages title + body JSON. Frontend ConfigTab has scrollable preview card + edit modal with live preview. Migration 039 seeds default ToS on fresh installs.

### Fixed
- **ACME /acme/terms endpoint** — returns raw `text/html` instead of JSON wrapper. No more escaped characters in HTML.
- **ACME directory** — `meta.termsOfService` URL points to `/acme/terms` for ACME clients.

## [2.162] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- ACME domain form (#123) — Radix Select fields (DNS provider, issuing CA) now display correctly instead of appearing blank. Values kept as strings in state (Radix requirement), converted to integers only on submit.
- ACME domain form — initial state for `dns_provider_id` now safely handles undefined values via optional chaining.
- Policies form — Radix Select values for CA and approval group now display correctly (strings for Radix compat).
- Duplicate CHANGELOG entries in 2.161 cleaned up.

## [2.161] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **CI semver normalization** — RC tags (`2.161-rc1`) are auto-normalized to valid semver (`2.161.0-rc1`) for `npm ci` in build workflows.
- **EAB credential notes** (#120) — free-form notes column on `acme_eab_credentials` table (migration 038), editable in ACME EAB tab.

### Changed
- **CI pipeline hardened** — `npm ci` now works reliably on RC tags; lockfile integrity preserved (no more blanket `sed` corruption).

### Fixed
- Password policy centralization (#121) — all validation moved to `security/password_policy.py`, enforced across login, password change, account creation, and force-change flows. Admin bypass retained.
- Discovery profiles (#122) — corrected field name mismatches (`schedule_enabled`, `schedule_interval_minutes`) in `DiscoveryPage.jsx` and `ProfileDetailPanel.jsx`; profile list now refreshes after create/update.
- All `db.session.commit()` calls wrapped in `safe_commit()` — prevents 500 crashes from IntegrityError.
- GitHub code scanning alerts: `react-router` → `6.30.4`, batch-updated Python dependencies.
- Frontend quality check: removed React 18 false-positive hook provider tests (479 tests clean).

## [2.160] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- ACME challenge responses no longer fail with an internal error when auditing an authorization identifier stored as JSON.
- Hardened ACME authorization identifier handling across challenge validation, authorization responses, wildcard detection, and ACME admin views.

## [2.159] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **CA-template pinning** (#118) — pin templates to specific CAs for quick access in certificate issuance form. Pinned templates appear with pushpin icon at top of dropdown, with option to show all templates. Backend API endpoints for pin/unpin operations, migration 037 adds `ca_template_pins` table.
- Manage Pins button in CA floating window action bar for quick access to template pinning modal.

### Fixed
- Template pinning UI: replaced emoji with PushPin icon from phosphor-icons for consistency.
- i18n interpolation in "Show all X templates" button now correctly displays template count.
- FloatingDetailWindow: fixed canWrite/canDelete props passing to CADetails component, preventing ReferenceError.
- CA details floating window now properly displays action buttons (Export, Manage Pins, Take Offline, Delete).

### Security
- Updated frontend dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities: engine.io-client (moderate), picomatch (high), brace-expansion (moderate), @vitest/coverage-v8 (critical).

## [2.158] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- SSH certificate issuance: cast TTL values to int to prevent str/int comparison error (#119)
- SSH setup script: fix import path after module reorganization (#119)
- mTLS certificate generation: use correct CertificateService method signature (#119)

## [2.157] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Webhook form: empty `auth_username` and `auth_header_name` fields now sent as `null` instead of `""`, preventing 400 validation errors when the field is optional for the selected auth type (#117).

## [2.156] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Webhook custom authentication** (#116) — five auth types per webhook: `none`, `bearer`, `basic`, `api_key`, `custom`. Tokens encrypted at rest, never returned in API responses (only `auth_token_set` boolean). PUT semantics: omitted token preserves existing, null clears, empty string is rejected.
- Migration 036 adds `auth_type`, `auth_token` (encrypted), `auth_username`, `auth_header_name` columns to `webhooks` (dual-backend SQLite + PostgreSQL).
- Webhook form UI: auth type selector with conditional fields (token, username, header name), live request-preview pane with token masking, explicit clear-token control.
- Audit events: `webhook.auth_configured`, `webhook.auth_disabled`, `webhook.auth_token_rotated`, `webhook.auth_token_invalid`.
- 18 backend integration tests + 20 frontend tests covering all 5 auth types, PUT semantics, validation errors, and token masking.
- Webhook auth documentation in settings help page (all 9 languages).

### Security
- `Authorization` header value blocked when `auth_type=api_key` (forces operator to use bearer/basic for that scheme).
- Token capped at 8192 bytes.
- Tokens stored using the same encrypted-property pattern as other secrets (master key in `/etc/ucm/master.key`).

### Fixed
- `DELETE /api/v2/webhooks/<id>` now returns 204 No Content (was 200 with body), aligning with the project DELETE convention.

## [2.155] - 2026-05-10

Auto-renewal UI, PostgreSQL migration recovery (closes [#115](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/115)), LAN-friendly rate limiting, and master-key backup safeguards.
Validated 6/6 across SQLite and PostgreSQL on Debian, RHEL/Fedora, and Docker.

### Added
- **Auto-renewal settings UI** — dedicated section in Settings to configure global renewal threshold, retry policy, scheduler interval, and per-CA overrides. Backend endpoints `GET/PUT /api/v2/settings/auto-renewal` with full validation.
- **Master-key backup UX** — new `GET /api/v2/system/security/master-key/download` endpoint (admin-only, audited). `enable-encryption` now returns the master key inline (one-time) with `backup_required: true`. Settings → Security shows a "Back Up Master Key" action when the key is file-sourced. A confirm-gated modal forces the operator to download and acknowledge before dismissal. The endpoint returns 409 when the key is supplied via environment variable (operator must back it up out-of-band).
- Dockerfile now declares `VOLUME ["/etc/ucm", "/opt/ucm/data"]` so master.key survives container recreation when no explicit bind mount is provided.

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL migrations** ([#115](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/115)) — migrations 029, 031, 032, 033, 034 are now dual-backend (SQLite + PostgreSQL). Adds reconcile migration `035_reconcile_pg_schema.py` to repair PG instances that booted on a SQLite-only release. The migration runner now refuses to start in strict mode if SQLite-only migrations would be skipped on PostgreSQL past the 020 boundary.

### Changed
- **Rate limiter** — LAN clients (RFC1918 + loopback) bypass rate limits by default (`RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_LAN=true`). Standard tier raised from 300/min to 600/min and from 60 burst to 100, removing false positives on busy on-prem deployments.

## [2.154] - 2026-05-10

Fixes OPNsense 26.1.x certificate import (closes [#114](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/114)).
Validated 6/6 across SQLite and PostgreSQL on Debian, RHEL/Fedora, and Docker.

### Fixed
- **OPNsense import** — three bugs prevented the API-based import path from working against OPNsense 26.1.x:
  - Frontend service did not unwrap `success_response.data`, so the items list was empty after `Connect` and the `Import Selected` button never rendered.
  - Backend stored OPNsense `uuid` as UCM `refid`, breaking the `caref` linkage between certificates and their CA (OPNsense uses the 13-char `refid` as cross-reference, not the 36-char `uuid`).
  - Imported private keys were stored raw instead of going through `store_pem_bytes()`, bypassing encryption-at-rest.
- Importer now performs a 2-pass import (CAs before certificates), resolves `caref` against in-flight CAs, extracts SAN/SKI/AKI/serial, falls back to `crt_payload`/`prv_payload` when `crt`/`prv` are absent, and treats an empty selection as "import all".
- Added regression test `test_opnsense_import.py` covering refid storage, caref linkage, and encrypted private-key round-trip.

## [2.153] - 2026-05-10

Adds CA offline mode (closes [#106](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/106)).
Validated 6/6 across SQLite and PostgreSQL on Debian, RHEL/Fedora, and Docker.

### Added
- **CA offline mode** — take any CA offline to block signing while keeping the public certificate usable for chain validation, CDP and OCSP. Two modes:
  - **Password-protected** — private key re-wrapped with a user-supplied password (PKCS#8) on top of the existing master-key wrap, restore requires the password.
  - **File-exported** — private key returned as a password-encrypted PKCS#8 PEM and removed from the database, restore requires re-uploading the file plus the password.
- Sign/issue/CRL paths gate on `ca.offline` (`csrs.py`, `services/cert/mixins/csr.py`, `services/ca/ca_signing.py`, `crl.py`). The legacy `update_ca` backdoor is closed — only the dedicated take-offline / restore endpoints can flip the flag.
- Frontend: `TakeOfflineModal`, `RestoreModal`, offline-aware `StatusBadge` + dedicated `OfflineBadge` across all 4 CA list views, action buttons in `CADetailsPanel` and the floating detail window.
- Audit actions: `ca.offline.password_protected`, `ca.offline.file_exported`, `ca.restore.password_protected`, `ca.restore.file_exported`.
- In-app help, GitHub wiki page (`CA-Offline-Mode`), and documentation in `USER_GUIDE.md` + `SECURITY.md` threat model.
- Migration `034_add_ca_offline.py` adds `offline`, `offline_reason`, `offline_mode` columns.

## [2.152] - 2026-05-08

Security and RFC-compliance hardening pass across all PKI protocols and resource APIs.
Smoke-tested across SQLite and PostgreSQL on Debian, RHEL/Fedora, and Docker (33 migrations from-scratch on PG verified).

### Security
- **Certificate authorities** — whitelist key params, cap validity at 3650 days, lock HSM-bound key, validate URLs (CRL DP / AIA / OCSP / IDP), cap bulk and list operations, harden create/update/export. CSR signing now verifies `is_signature_valid` (proof of possession). EC curve restricted to a whitelist.
- **Certificates** — whitelist key params, cap validity, fix unhold bugs.
- **CSRs** — cap validity, validate keys, verify CSR pubkey ↔ submitted match, cap PEM size 64 KB.
- **Templates** — cap validity_days, whitelist key_type/digest, fix import NULL.
- **Policies / approvals** — enforce group gate, expiry and validity reclamp.
- **Users** — require current password for self-change, protect last admin (≥1 active admin invariant).
- **RBAC** — validate role payload, reject reserved names (`admin`/`operator`/`viewer`), permission whitelist with wildcard.
- **SSO** — add PKCE (S256) and nonce to OIDC auth flow.
- **HSM** — encrypt provider secrets at rest, cap sign payload at 1 MiB, FK-guard deletes; runtime `pip install` disabled by default (opt-in via `UCM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_PIP=1`).
- **Microsoft CA** — fail-closed encryption, EOBO admin gate, audit, size caps.
- **Webhooks** — encrypt secret at rest, validate event names against allowlist, lock reserved headers, cap events per webhook.
- **Discovery** — validate ports, IPv6 subnet cap (≤1024), gate `update_profile`.
- **Audit** — trusted-proxy XFF (only honour `X-Forwarded-For` from configured proxies), fix invalid kwargs in ACME audit, post-cleanup integrity check.
- **Reports** — cap generate params dict size (DoS guard).
- **SSH** — validate sign/generate payload (caps on principals ≤64, extensions/options ≤32, validity 60 s – 10 y).
- **Trust store** — whitelist purpose, cap PEM size 256 KB, sync limit 1–1000.
- **ACME (server)** — close 6 RFC 8555 auth bypasses (account binding, order ownership, authz state machine, finalize URL, key change, deactivation).
- **ACME (proxy)** — block SSRF via forged proxy IDs; finalize ownership check.
- **ACME (client)** — validate domain syntax, cap inputs, harden commits.
- **EAB** — encrypt HMAC keys at rest.
- **EST** — proof of possession, serialize bug fixes, config bound validation.
- **SCEP** — tighten challenge auth, audit reads, validate config bounds.

### Fixed (RFC compliance)
- **OCSP (RFC 6960)** — handle mixed-format serials in DB lookup (decimal / lower hex / upper hex), invalidate cache on revoke, correct `keyHash` calculation, honour `nonce` extension (skip cache when present), refuse delegated responder cert without `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`.
- **CRL (RFC 5280)** — handle mixed-format serials, drop silent truncation of serials >159 bits, auto-regen expired CRL on CDP fetch.
- **Certificate profile (RFC 5280)** — 5 issues fixed in CA/CSR signing paths (SKI/AKI format, BasicConstraints encoding, EKU consistency, KU bit ordering, validity bounds).
- **ACME (RFC 8555 / 8737)** — EAB JWK match via thumbprint, JWS algorithm allowlist (asymmetric only), wildcard domain restricted to DNS-01, ALPN extension marked critical, case-insensitive domain handling. Pre-authorisation flow (§7.4.1) — `acme_authorizations.order_id` now nullable (migration 033).
- **TSA (RFC 3161 / 5035)** — `signing-certificate-v2` ESS attribute now mandatory, request body capped at 64 KiB, correct `PKIStatus` separation from `PKIFailureInfo`.
- **EST (RFC 7030)** — `serverkeygen` encrypts the server-generated key under the **client mTLS pubkey**, not under the newly issued cert.
- **SCEP (RFC 8894)** — reject renewal when signer cert is expired or not yet valid.

### Fixed (other)
- **Imports** — CA and certificate import endpoints now encrypt private keys via `encrypt_private_key` instead of storing base64-plain (silent regression introduced when import paths bypassed the lifecycle mixin).

### Added
- **`tools/decode-csr` and `tools/decode-cert`** — input capped at 256 KiB → `413` (DoS guard).

### Tests
- 1676 backend tests + 461 frontend tests pass.
- 2 encryption-related tests made hermetic to host `master.key` (monkeypatch `MASTER_KEY_PATH` and use `is_string_encrypted()`).

## [2.151] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy did not enforce External Account Binding (#112)** — when `acme_eab_required` was enabled, the proxy directory at `/acme/proxy/directory` advertised upstream Let's Encrypt's `meta` as-is (which does not require EAB), so clients like win-acme reported "server does not indicate that this is required" and proceeded to register an account without an `externalAccountBinding`. The proxy `POST /acme/proxy/new-account` likewise never inspected the payload for an EAB field and accepted any registration. The proxy now (1) overrides `meta.externalAccountRequired` with the local UCM policy in its directory, and (2) validates the `externalAccountBinding` JWS in `/new-account` exactly like the local server, rejecting registrations without a valid HMAC binding when EAB is required.
- **Local `/acme/new-account` returned 500 on empty body** — `request.get_json()` raised on requests with `Content-Type: application/jose+json` and an empty body instead of producing a clean `400 malformed`. Now uses `force=True, silent=True` so empty/invalid payloads return the documented ACME error.
- **ACME admin UI 404 on account detail (#113)** — the admin routes `GET/DELETE /api/v2/acme/accounts/<id>`, `POST .../deactivate`, `GET .../orders`, `GET .../challenges` only resolved by numeric primary key, but the UI passes the public `account_id` string. New `resolve_acme_account()` helper accepts either form and is used by all five admin routes; protocol routes (RFC 8555) are unchanged.
- **`refactor(acme): bind directory_url to account key via AcmeClientAccount table`** — landed in this release: the on-disk account key file is now selected by joining `AcmeAccount.directory_url` to the matching `AcmeClientAccount` row, removing the previous heuristic that looked up the key by directory URL string match alone.

### Tests
- **`tests/conftest.py::create_user`** — made the factory idempotent on session-DB collisions, so a test that re-uses a user hint (or a sharded CI re-run) no longer fails with HTTP 500 on the second create. The full backend suite (1676 + 209 ACME + frontend 461) is green on all three distros.

## [2.150] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **ACME default environment ignored when payload omits it (#26)** — `POST /api/v2/acme/client/accounts` and `POST /api/v2/acme/client/orders` always defaulted to staging (`environment='staging'`) when the request body did not specify one, even though Settings → ACME → Let's Encrypt let operators pin a default environment via `acme.client.environment`. New ACME accounts and on-demand orders created from the frontend (which never sends `environment` in the body) silently went to staging instead of production. Both endpoints now read `SystemConfig['acme.client.environment']` when the field is omitted, falling back to `'staging'` only if no default is configured. The frontend `ACMEPage` modal now also waits for `clientSettings` to load before opening, eliminating a race that briefly defaulted the dropdown to staging at mount.
- **DELETE on templates and certificates failed on FK violation** — `DELETE /api/v2/templates/<id>` did not check if the template was referenced by certificates or policies before issuing the delete, raising `IntegrityError` (HTTP 500) when the template was in use. Now blocks with `409 Conflict` and a "used by N certificate(s) / N policy/policies" message; operators must remove the dependents first. `delete_certificate` in `services/cert/mixins/lifecycle.py` did not clean up `ApprovalRequest` rows pointing to the certificate, hitting the same FK class of failure on certs that had ever been the subject of an approval workflow. Cleanup is now wrapped in a try/except with explicit rollback.
- **Unprotected `db.session.commit()` in 39 service-layer call sites** — bare commits across 20 service modules (acme_renewal, audit/query, auto_renewal, backup/restore_core, ca/{ca_creation,ca_crud,ca_operations,ca_signing}, cert/mixins/{csr,import_export,lifecycle}, crl/generation, discovery/{profiles,query,scanner}, hsm/hsm_service, opnsense/config, policy_service, ski_aki_backfill, template_service) had no surrounding `try/except`. On any commit failure (constraint violation, disconnected DB, deadlock) SQLAlchemy left the session in a broken-transaction state, causing every subsequent request handled by the same worker to fail with `PendingRollbackError` until the worker recycled. All 39 sites are now wrapped: `try: db.session.commit(); except Exception as e: db.session.rollback(); logger.error(..., exc_info=True); raise` — same caller-side behavior, just a guaranteed rollback.
- **PostgreSQL upgrades crashed at boot on migration 030 (#111)** — `030_add_certificate_san_upn._upgrade_pg(engine)` opened `with engine.begin() as conn:` but the migration runner already passes the live, transactional `Connection` to `mod.upgrade(conn)` (fixed in #103/#104). Calling `.begin()` on an already-bound `Connection` raises `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: a transaction is already begun on this connection`, killing the boot of every PostgreSQL install upgrading to v2.149. Reported by @Hemsby. Migration 030 now uses the runner-supplied `Connection` directly. The same latent bug existed in eight earlier `pg_compatible` migrations (020, 021, 022, 023, 024, 025, 026, 027 EAB, 027 backfill SAN email) — they were invisible because previously applied installs never re-ran them, but a fresh PostgreSQL install would have hit the same crash on first migration. All nine are converted to the `_upgrade_pg(conn)` shape and use the supplied connection directly.
- **Test guard against future regressions** — added `test_pg_migrations_do_not_open_nested_transactions` in `tests/test_migration_runner_pg.py` that AST-scans every `pg_compatible` migration and rejects any call to `engine.begin()` / `conn.begin()`. The pre-commit hook will catch any new migration that re-introduces the pattern. End-to-end check `test_pg_migration_runs_against_real_postgres` was rerun against a real PostgreSQL 15 container and passes.

## [2.149] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Microsoft UPN SAN support (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3)** — CSRs and certificates can now carry User Principal Names in the Subject Alternative Name extension, the format Microsoft Active Directory expects for smart-card / certificate-based logon. UPN values are validated (`user@domain` form, no whitespace), DER-encoded as `OtherName(UPN_OID, UTF8String)` via `asn1crypto`, persisted in a new `certificates.san_upn` column (JSON array, migration `030_add_certificate_san_upn.py`, multi-backend SQLite + PostgreSQL), and surfaced in the UI through a new `UPN` option in the SAN editor on both the CSR creation page and the issue-certificate form. Internal CA issuance, ACME, EST, SCEP, and the `POST /api/v2/csrs` and `POST /api/v2/certificates` endpoints all accept UPN entries via the `UPN:` prefix in the unified `san` array. The detail panel renders them in `san_combined` as `UPN:user@corp.local`. Read-side parser already supports them via `utils/cert_extensions.py`.
- **EOBO auto-fill prefers UPN SAN** — when enabling Enroll-On-Behalf-Of in the Microsoft CA submission flow, the enrollee UPN field now auto-populates from the CSR's UPN SAN first, then falls back to SAN email, then to the subject `emailAddress`. Operators no longer have to retype the UPN that was already encoded in the CSR.

### Fixed
- **Microsoft CA issuance created a duplicate Certificate row** — `_import_signed_cert` in `api/v2/msca.py` issued an `INSERT` for a brand-new `Certificate` (with `source='msca'`) AND an in-place `UPDATE` of the originating CSR row, leaving two records for the same certificate (the CSR-derived one without `source`, so it was missing the `ADCS` tag in the UI). Now the CSR row is upgraded in-place into a full certificate (subject, issuer, serial, AKI/SKI, validity, SANs refreshed from the issued cert, `source='msca'`) and `MSCARequest.cert_id` points to it. The fallback `INSERT` path is kept for the (currently unused) case where there is no originating CSR.
- **ACME default environment Select didn't persist** — the Select on Settings → ACME → Let's Encrypt always reverted to Staging after reload. Frontend was reading/writing `default_environment` and `contact_email`, but `GET/PATCH /api/v2/acme/client/settings` uses the keys `environment` and `email`. The PATCH was silently dropped (unknown key) and the GET response was never read on the UI side, so the dropdown could never reflect a saved value. Aligned `LetsEncryptTab` and `ACMEPage` on the actual backend keys (#110).

## [2.148] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **SSO connection test endpoint crash** — `POST /api/v2/sso/providers/<id>/test` raised `NameError: name '_test_saml_connection' is not defined` (and the OAuth2/LDAP variants), making the "Test connection" button unusable for every SSO provider type. Discovered while smoke-testing v2.147 in production. Audit of the whole `api/v2/sso/` package surfaced six more files missing imports after the modular refactor — `connection_tests` (`http_requests`, `utc_isoformat`, `validate_url_not_cloud_metadata`), `ldap_routes` (`session`, `urllib`, `_ldap_authenticate_user`), `login_routes` (`http_requests`, `json`, `_get_ssl_verify`, `_cleanup_ssl_verify`, `_parse_json_field`, `_get_or_create_sso_user`, `_get_saml_auth`), `mapping_tests` (`_decrypt_ldap_password`, `_build_ldap_tls`), `saml_routes` (`safe_fromstring`, `utc_now`, `utc_isoformat`), plus `providers` itself. None of these endpoints were exercised by unit tests, so the regressions only surfaced on real production traffic.
- **Project-wide static audit** — added `backend/scripts/audit_undefined_names.py` (AST-based detection of names referenced but never defined or imported, taking nested-tuple destructuring into account) and `backend/scripts/audit_imports.py` (smoke-imports every backend module to catch `NameError` / `ImportError` at load time before any HTTP request hits the route). Both checks are now wired into the pre-commit hook (`scripts/pre-commit`), so a refactor that drops an import is rejected at commit time instead of being discovered in production.
- **`services/opnsense/parser.py` import crash** — the module imported `defusedxml.ElementTree as ET` then referenced `ET.Element` in type annotations, but `defusedxml.ElementTree` does not expose an `Element` class (`AttributeError` at import time). Now imports `Element` from the stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` for typing while keeping `defusedxml` for parsing. Caught by the new import-smoke audit.
- **`api/v2/certificates/bulk.py` missing imports** — used `os`, `subprocess` and `tempfile` (PKCS#7 export via OpenSSL CLI fallback) without importing them. Caught by the new audit.

## [2.147] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **ACME account detail tabs** — Orders and Challenges counts always rendered as 0 and the Orders/Challenges tabs were empty. Frontend was reading `res.data.orders` / `res.data.challenges` but the API returns the array directly under `res.data`; backend endpoints `GET /api/v2/acme/accounts/<account_id>/{orders,challenges,deactivate}` and `GET|DELETE /api/v2/acme/accounts/<account_id>` were also using `Query.get(account_id)` against an integer primary key when `account_id` is the public string identifier, so every lookup returned 404 (#109).
- **Local ACME history challenge type** — entries from the local ACME server always reported `challenge_type=http-01`. Now resolved from the first validated `AcmeChallenge` of the order so DNS-01 / TLS-ALPN-01 issuances are reported correctly (#109).
- **SSO SAML login crash** — `/api/v2/sso/login/saml` and `/api/v2/sso/callback/saml` raised `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` (and `_get_saml_auth` / `traceback`) on the first error path, masking the real failure. Added the missing `logging`, `traceback`, and `_get_saml_auth` imports in `api/v2/sso/login_routes.py`, plus `logger` in `api/v2/sso/mapping_tests.py` and `api/v2/sso/connection_tests.py` (audit confirmed no other runtime modules were affected).

## [2.146] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Release workflow** — validate stable tags against `main` and prerelease tags against `test`, and stamp `VERSION` / frontend package metadata before every frontend build so published DEB, RPM, and Docker artefacts embed the correct UI version (#108).

## [2.145] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **ACME Local server tab** — restored the `GET`/`PATCH /api/v2/acme/settings` endpoint and passed the missing `cas` prop to `ConfigTab`, fixing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` that crashed the Local ACME tab on click (#107).
- **Boot import** — re-exported `commit_or_rollback` from `utils/db_transaction` (lost during a refactor) so the service starts cleanly.

## [2.144] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`utils/key_codec.py`** — `load_pem_bytes(prv, *, context)` / `store_pem_bytes(pem)` helpers that consolidate the previously duplicated `base64.b64decode(decrypt_private_key(model.prv))` pattern across 26 sites in `api/v2/*` and `services/*`. Errors now surface a caller-supplied context (`"CA 42"`, `"certificate 17"`) instead of an opaque `binascii.Error` when a stored `.prv` is malformed or was encrypted with a different `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- **`utils/db_transaction.commit_or_rollback()`** — boolean-returning service-layer counterpart to `safe_commit()` (which is Flask-response-returning). Replaces 10 bare `db.session.commit()` calls in `auth/unified.py`, `services/mtls_auth_service.py`, `services/webauthn_service.py` that previously could leak partial transactions on integrity errors.
- **`security/encryption.encrypt_text()` / `decrypt_text()`** — text-oriented helpers (PEM, JSON blobs, plain strings) that share the same wire format as `encrypt_string()` but never confuse the caller about the input contract. The mixed `encrypt()` (expects base64) vs `encrypt_string()` (expects text) split caused #105.
- **Generic release tooling** — `scripts/smoke_release.py` (auth/CDP/OCSP/EST/health probe), `scripts/release_publish.sh` (tag + GitHub release publish), `scripts/wiki_release_notes.py` (changelog → wiki page generator). Lab-specific hostnames removed; everything is parameterised via `UCM_BASE` env var.
- **CI workflows** — `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the backend suite against both SQLite and PostgreSQL on every push (closes the gap that let #103 ship). `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` runs `smoke_release.py` against the published artefacts after every `v*` tag.
- **Pytest `postgres` marker** — opt-in marker for tests that require a live PostgreSQL backend; skipped by default locally, always run in CI.

### Fixed
- **Silent `except Exception: pass` blocks in critical auth/security paths now log with `exc_info=True`.** Specifically: `auth/unified.py` (4 sites: lockout config read, account-locked notification, login/logout WebSocket broadcasts, SMTP probe), `api/v2/auth.py` (7 sites: password policy import, password reset audit, etc.), `security/csrf.py` (CSRF token extraction failures), `security/encryption.py`, `config/https_manager.py`, `services/audit/core.py`, `services/email_service.py`, `services/syslog_service.py`, `utils/backup_codes.py`. These were not bugs in themselves but made post-mortem debugging of auth failures effectively impossible.
- **Latent #105-class regressions** — 4 additional sites that round-tripped PEM through `encrypt()`/`decrypt()` were migrated to `encrypt_text()`/`decrypt_text()`.
- **10 bare `db.session.commit()` sites** in auth/mTLS/WebAuthn paths now wrap in `commit_or_rollback()` and rollback cleanly on `IntegrityError`.

### Changed
- **26-site refactor** to `utils/key_codec.load_pem_bytes()`. Behaviour-preserving (asserted by `TestEquivalenceWithLegacyPattern` test class); reduces import footprint (single `utils.key_codec` import vs `base64` + `security.encryption`).

### Tests
- `tests/test_key_codec.py` (8 tests) — round-trip with/without `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, error messages with caller context, byte-for-byte equivalence with the legacy inline pattern.
- `tests/test_db_transaction.py` (5 tests) — `commit_or_rollback()` returns False + rolls back on `IntegrityError`, returns True on success, no double-rollback when called twice.
- `tests/test_pem_encryption_helpers.py`, `tests/test_acme_proxy_key_encrypted.py`, `tests/test_key_encryption_pem_passthrough.py`, `tests/test_migration_runner_pg.py` — regression coverage for #103/#104/#105 to prevent re-introduction.

### Internal
- Backend suite: 1645 passed / 1 skipped (was 1632 / 1 in v2.143).
- Frontend suite: 461 passed.

## [2.143] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL migration runner crashed on startup** when applying any pending migration written for the legacy `Engine` interface. `_run_pending_pg()` now opens a single transactional `Connection` via `engine.begin()` and passes it to `mod.upgrade(conn)`, matching the SQLite path and the migration module signatures (#103, #104). Without this fix, fresh PostgreSQL deployments couldn't boot past first start, and existing PG instances couldn't apply any future migration.
- **ACME proxy account private key was stored in plaintext in `system_config`.** It is now encrypted at rest with the application key via `encrypt_private_key()` / `decrypt_private_key()`, and existing plaintext keys are migrated transparently on first read (#105).
- **`KeyEncryption.decrypt()` no longer raises `binascii.Error` on PEM-formatted input** that was never encrypted in the first place. The probe now isolates base64 detection from Fernet decryption so legacy plaintext keys round-trip cleanly through the new ACME proxy decrypt path.

### Changed
- **Cross-target release validation now covers PostgreSQL** in addition to SQLite for every supported package (DEB, RPM, Docker). The PostgreSQL backend is now part of the mandatory pre-release smoke matrix because the #103 regression only manifested on PostgreSQL and would have shipped silently against a SQLite-only matrix.

## [2.142] - 2026-05-02

### Security
- **EST `/cacerts`, `/simpleenroll`, `/simplereenroll`, `/serverkeygen`, `/csrattrs` now enforce `est_enabled` on every request** and short-circuit with `503 EST disabled` instead of falling through to the SPA. The `/serverkeygen` body is also size-capped and stricter about content negotiation.
- **EST and SCEP mTLS client certificates are only honoured when the request comes from a trusted reverse proxy** (`security.trusted_proxies`). Direct hits without TLS termination by UCM no longer accept proxy-injected client cert headers.
- **mTLS login route gated behind trusted-proxy check.** Same protection as EST/SCEP — header-based mTLS is rejected unless the request originates from a trusted proxy.
- **2FA backup codes are now hashed at rest** (Argon2id) and consumed atomically; plaintext codes are returned only at generation time and never stored.
- **Approval quorum is race-safe and idempotent.** Concurrent approvals on the same request can no longer over-approve; double-submits are deduplicated.
- **On-demand CRL generation is serialised per-CA** with a per-CA lock and `503 Retry-After: 5` under contention — closes a CPU/IO DoS vector when many clients hit `/cdp/<ca>.crl` simultaneously.
- **Outbound webhooks revalidate the resolved IP at delivery time** (DNS-rebinding window closed) and reject cloud-metadata IPs (`169.254.169.254`, GCP/Azure/Alibaba equivalents) and loopback. RFC1918 / `.lan` / `.local` targets remain allowed by design (UCM is on-prem).
- **SSO/IdP, ACME proxy and webhook URL fields all share the same SSRF helper** (`validate_url_not_cloud_metadata`) — cloud metadata is blocked everywhere.
- **CSV bulk user-import capped at 5 MB / 10 000 rows** with `413` on overflow.
- **Runtime HSM `pip install` disabled by default**, returns `403` with a hint to set `UCM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_PIP=1` or install the dependency via the system package manager.
- **SCEP CSRs no longer copy arbitrary KU/EKU bits** — only a whitelist (`digitalSignature`, `keyEncipherment`, `serverAuth`, `clientAuth`) is honoured.
- **SCEP RFC 8894 P0/P1/P2 hardening** — stricter PKCS#7 parsing, transaction-ID validation, signed/encrypted response envelope checks; iOS/macOS enrollment fixes (#102).
- **ACME account private keys encrypted at rest** with the application key.
- **Password change endpoint ignores client-supplied `force_change`** (only operators can clear that flag).
- **CSRF token entropy increased**; password hash algorithm tightened; database migration identifiers validated against an allow-list.
- **`ProxyFix` is opt-in** via `security.trusted_proxies` — prevents unauthenticated `X-Forwarded-For` spoofing on direct deployments.
- **Filesystem session directory is now created/enforced at mode `0o700`** and the application refuses to boot if it has group/world-readable bits.
- **EST audit lines use the trusted-proxy-aware client IP** instead of the raw socket address.

### Added
- `utils/trusted_proxy.py` — shared `is_request_from_trusted_proxy()` / `client_ip()` / `reject_untrusted_proxy_headers()` helpers used by EST, SCEP, mTLS login and audit.
- `utils/ssrf_protection.py` — single source of truth for `validate_url_not_cloud_metadata` and `validate_host_not_cloud_metadata`, used by webhooks, SSO, ACME proxy, OPNsense import.
- `utils/safe_commit.py`, `utils/require_json_body`, `utils/parse_request_pagination`, `utils/safe_call`, `utils/audit_event` — small composable helpers applied across `api/v2/*` to remove boilerplate and silence intermittent rollback bugs.
- `useCRUDPage` frontend hook covering 4 list/create/edit pages.

### Changed
- **Massive backend modularisation.** `system.py` (1556 l), `certificates.py` (2220 l), `cas.py` (1245 l), `ssh_cas.py` (1607 l), `database_admin` (817 l), `discovery_service`, `pdf_generator`, `scep_service` (981 l), `acme_service` (1456 l → 7 mixins ≤350 l), `trust_store` (1487 l), `ca_service` (788 l), `restore_mixin`, `notification_service`, `audit_service`, `crl_service`, `ssh_cert_service`, `msca_service`, `account.py`, `acme.py`, `tools.py`, `acme_client.py`, `users.py`, `settings.py`, `opnsense_import` and `models/__init__.py` were split into focused submodules. Behaviour is unchanged; module size, test isolation and review surface improve.
- **Frontend modularisation.** `CAsPage`, `CertificatesPage`, `DiscoveryPage`, `ACMEPage`, `SettingsPage` and `SsoProviderForm` split into per-section sub-components under `pages/<feature>/`.
- All `api/v2/*` `db.session.commit()` calls now go through `safe_commit()` — consistent rollback + error logging on every write path.

### Fixed
- **PKCS12/PFX export now honours the `include_chain` flag** (#100). Previously the CA chain was always included, regardless of the request.
- **Dashboard chart cards no longer overflow the grid** and System Health gained an internal scrollbar (#99).
- iOS/macOS SCEP enrollment regressions (#102).

### Internal
- ~20 test files de-duplicated against `conftest.py`; pre-commit i18n + 461 frontend + 1613 backend tests gate every commit.
- RC validated end-to-end on Debian (`pve:8445`), Fedora (`fedor:8443`) and Docker (`pve:8444`): smoke API 8/8 and Playwright use-cases 10/10 on all three targets.

## [2.141] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Admin lockout prevented on database backend switch** (#96). Switching the database backend (SQLite ↔ PostgreSQL) no longer locks the admin out. Boolean and JSON columns are now coerced correctly when migrating rows from SQLite to PostgreSQL, the migration runs per-table in its own transaction so a single bad row no longer aborts the whole switch, and the active admin session survives the cutover.
- **PostgreSQL backups via `pg_dump`.** The Docker image now ships `postgresql-client`, so PostgreSQL-backed instances can produce native `pg_dump` backups during backend migrations and scheduled backups.

### Changed
- **In-app help covers v2.128–v2.140 features** in English plus all 8 translated languages (fr, de, es, it, ja, pt, uk, zh).
- **README features and roadmap refreshed** for v2.128 → v2.140.

### Internal
- CI: backend test collection no longer fails on missing `SECRET_KEY` / `JWT_SECRET_KEY` — workflow now exports test-mode env vars before pytest runs.

## [2.140] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Certificate SAN database columns now derived from the final SAN list** (#94). When a CN is auto-promoted to an `rfc822Name` SAN at issuance, the `san_email` / `san_dns` / `san_ip` / `san_uri` columns are now written from the canonical SAN list instead of the raw form payload, so DB queries match the X.509 extension. Migration `027_backfill_san_email` re-parses existing certificate PEMs and backfills any rows that were out of sync (idempotent on SQLite and PostgreSQL). Thanks @Hemsby.
- **Certificate and CA files written to disk on creation** (#95). Added SQLAlchemy `after_insert` listeners on the `Certificate` and `CA` models that immediately materialize `.crt` / `.key` files under `data/certs/` and `data/cas/` for every creation path (UI, CSR signing, ACME, SCEP, import). The startup file-regeneration scan is kept as a safety net. File-write errors are logged but never abort the database transaction. Thanks @Hemsby.

## [2.139] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **ACME External Account Binding (EAB) — RFC 8555 §7.3.4.** Full EAB credentials manager (backend models, API, UI under ACME → EAB Credentials). Operators can issue, list, rotate and revoke `kid` / `hmac` pairs; clients (cert-manager, certbot, acme.sh) bind their account on `newAccount` via JWS over the MAC key. Brings UCM in line with public ACME CAs (Let's Encrypt EAB, ZeroSSL, Google Trust Services).
- **ACME custom DNS resolvers for DNS-01 validation.** Per-account override of system resolvers when validating `_acme-challenge` TXT records. Useful for split-horizon DNS, internal authoritatives, or when public resolvers cache stale records during automated renewals.
- **ACME on internal / private IPs — gated by `acme.allow_private_ips` SystemConfig (default `true`).** HTTP-01 and TLS-ALPN-01 validation now works out of the box for RFC1918, loopback, `.lan` / `.local` / `.corp` targets — UCM's primary deployment model. Cloud metadata IPs (`169.254.169.254`) remain blocked unconditionally.
- **Kubernetes & cert-manager integration.** Reference manifests under `examples/kubernetes/cert-manager/` (HTTP-01 ClusterIssuer, DNS-01 ClusterIssuer with EAB, sample Certificate, EAB Secret template, README). Full integration guide on the wiki and on https://ucm.tools/docs.

### Changed
- **ACME audit & RBAC hardening.** Challenge state transitions now produce audit records on terminal states (`valid` / `invalid`) instead of every poll, eliminating audit log noise. `account.key_change` (RFC 8555 §7.3.5) is audited. `delete:acme` permission added to the `operator` role to match `write:acme`.
- **ACME backup/restore parity.** `acme_eab_credentials` is now exported and restored alongside `acme_accounts`; full account fields (contact, status, terms-of-service, external-account-binding metadata) are now round-tripped end-to-end.

### Fixed
- `backend/services/ssh_cas.py` — converted f-strings containing escape sequences to raw f-strings to silence Python `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence` on 3.12+.

## [2.138] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **CAs page silently dropped CAs beyond the first 20 (#89)** — `GET /api/v2/cas` defaulted to `per_page=20` even when no pagination parameters were supplied, so a fresh import of 24 CAs only displayed 20 in `Certificate Authorities`. The endpoint now returns the full set when no pagination is requested, and continues to honour `page` / `per_page` when they are explicitly provided.
- **API key creation UX & no-expiration support (#90)** — three regressions in `Account → API Keys`:
  - Newly issued keys are now shown in a dedicated modal with the full key in a `<code>` block, an explicit copy button, and a warning that the key won't be shown again. The previous toast disappeared too quickly and its copy button copied the literal string `undefined`.
  - The list view's per-key "copy" affordance now renders the real key prefix (e.g. `ucm_ak_AbC1`) instead of `undefined…`. Backed by a new `key_prefix` column persisted at creation time. Migration `026_add_api_key_prefix` adds the column on SQLite and PostgreSQL; legacy keys without a stored prefix render an "unavailable (legacy key)" placeholder.
  - Leaving the expiration field empty now creates a key that **never expires**, matching the field's helper text. The backend distinguishes "field absent" (keeps the historical 365-day default for API/CLI compatibility) from explicit `null` / `0` / `""` (no expiration). Validation rejects negative or non-integer values with HTTP 400.

## [2.137] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Datetime serialisation now consistently UTC across the API (#87)** — every `datetime.isoformat()` returned by the backend now carries an explicit `Z` suffix via the new `utc_isoformat()` helper. Frontend components (audit log viewer, dashboards, certificate detail) consistently render in the user's local timezone without ambiguity. Backend-wide sweep: 84 auto-fixed call sites + 9 manual fixes; full backend test suite (1558 tests) green.
- **Windows SSH Host/User CA setup script — clearer diagnostics on `Add-WindowsCapability` failure (#75).** When OpenSSH Server install fails on a domain-joined / WSUS-managed machine (typical errors `0x8024500c WU_E_PT_WMT_MISSING`, `0x800f0954`, WU connectivity codes), the script now prints a labelled diagnostic block: classifies the error, reports the detected `UseWUServer` / `WUServer` group-policy values, and lists three policy-compliant remediation paths (WSUS approval / FoD-from-WU policy / offline FoD ISO / manual install via Optional Features). The script never modifies WSUS or update policy itself — it explains the problem so the Windows / AD team can fix it.

## [2.136] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Smart Import duplicate detection (#85)** — duplicate detection across `Smart Import`, `Auto-Renewal`, and mTLS enrollment previously matched only on `serial_number`. Per RFC 5280, serials are only unique per-issuer, so two unrelated certs from different CAs that happened to share a serial were flagged as duplicates (or worse, the wrong cert was returned).
  - New helper `find_existing_cert_by_identity()` uses an indexed `(serial_number, issuer DN)` pre-filter (RFC 5280) and confirms with the **SHA-256 fingerprint of the DER bytes** — globally unique, immune to PEM reformatting, 0% false positives.
  - Applied to: `services/smart_import/validator._check_duplicate_cert()`, `services/smart_import/importer` (CA + leaf cert paths), `api/v2/users` mTLS import, `api/v2/mtls` mTLS enrollment.
  - Auto-renewal lookup now also scopes by `caref` to disambiguate identical serials issued by different CAs.
## [2.135] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Database Stats panel on PostgreSQL (#83)** — `Settings → Database` previously showed `-` for size and `Never` for `Last Optimized` on PostgreSQL deployments, and the panel never refreshed after `Optimize` / `Integrity Check`.
  - `get_db_stats()` now queries `pg_database_size(current_database())` on PostgreSQL (was using `os.path.getsize` on the SQLite file path → always `0` → frontend rendered `-`).
  - `Last Optimized` and `Last Integrity Check` timestamps are persisted via `SystemConfig` (`db_last_optimized`, `db_last_integrity_check`) and surfaced from `get_db_stats()` (was hardcoded `Never` with a TODO).
  - `SettingsPage` now re-runs `loadDbStats()` after `Optimize` and `Integrity Check` succeed.
- **Certificate Activity chart on PostgreSQL (#84)** — the dashboard chart always rendered all-zero bars on PostgreSQL.
  - Replaced SQLite-only boolean comparisons (`revoked = 0`, `is_active = 1`, `ocsp_enabled = 1`, `cdp_enabled = 1`, `active = 1`) with `IS NOT TRUE` / `= true`, which work on both SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  - Replaced SQLite-only `datetime('now', '+30 days')` in the auto-renewal status query with Python-computed bounds passed as parameters.
  - Without these fixes, the shared `try` block in `get_certificate_trend()` raised `operator does not exist: boolean = integer` on PostgreSQL and the `except` handler returned an empty trend for all three series.

## [2.134] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **SMTP OAuth2 (XOAUTH2) for Gmail, Outlook.com & Microsoft 365 (#67)** — modern OAuth2 authentication for outbound mail, replacing legacy app-password flows that Microsoft and Google are deprecating.
  - Three provider presets (Gmail / Outlook.com / Microsoft 365) auto-fill SMTP host, port, scopes and authorization endpoints. A "Custom OAuth2" option remains for power users who need to register their own Entra/Workspace app.
  - Outlook.com personal accounts use a simplified flow that does not require tenant ID / client secret — the user just authorizes UCM with their Microsoft account.
  - Microsoft 365 (Entra) flow keeps the full tenant-id / client-id / client-secret form for org admins.
  - Per-provider helpers display the exact redirect URI to register, and the UI surfaces clear guidance when a refresh token is missing or unverified.
  - Tokens are stored encrypted; refresh is automatic on send.
- **Friendlier Windows SSH CA setup (#75)** — the PowerShell script generated by `/ssh/setup` no longer closes the prompt before the user can read the output, and ships with a self-elevating one-liner that downloads the script, opens an elevated `-NoExit` PowerShell, and bypasses `ExecutionPolicy` for that single run. Works around hosts where `.ps1` files are blocked by policy.

### Fixed
- **Database maintenance & integrity check on PostgreSQL (#82)** — `Optimize Database` and `Check Integrity` previously assumed SQLite and failed on PostgreSQL deployments.
  - `optimize_db()` now branches on the configured backend: SQLite runs `VACUUM` + `ANALYZE` via the standard session, PostgreSQL runs `VACUUM ANALYZE` on a dedicated `AUTOCOMMIT` connection (PG forbids VACUUM inside a transaction).
  - `check_integrity()` runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` / `foreign_key_check` on SQLite, and a connectivity + `information_schema.tables` probe on PostgreSQL.
  - Frontend `handleIntegrityCheck` was reading the response payload at the wrong nesting level, so the success toast never fired even on SQLite — now reads `response.data.passed` consistently with the rest of the API surface.
  - Both endpoints continue to use the standard `success_response` envelope.

## [2.133] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **SSO Default Role overrides UCM-managed roles on every login (#81)** — until v2.132, `_resolve_role` was called inside `auto_update_users` for existing users and always fell back to `default_role` when no `role_mapping` matched. The result: any role change made in the UCM UI (e.g. promoting a user to `admin`) was silently reverted to the provider's `default_role` on the next SSO login. Two semantically separate concerns — userinfo sync (email/full name) and role sync — were also conflated under a single toggle.
  - `auto_update_users` now controls **userinfo only** (email, full name) and never touches the role.
  - `default_role` is now strictly a **creation-time** value.
  - Role re-sync at login is opt-in via a new `sync_role_on_login` flag (default `false`). When enabled, the role is updated only if `role_mapping` resolves the user's external groups to a UCM role; if no mapping matches, the stored role is preserved (no `default_role` fallback for existing users).
  - New backend helper `_resolve_role_from_mapping()` returns `None` when no mapping match is found, making the existing-user code path explicit.
  - DB migration `023_sso_sync_role_on_login` adds the new column to `pro_sso_providers` (SQLite + PostgreSQL).
  - SSO settings UI gains a "Sync role from SSO on each login" toggle on LDAP, OAuth2 and SAML provider forms, with explanatory help text.
  - Help content updated (in-app help + 9 i18n locales).
  - Backend tests added covering the four behaviours: existing user role preserved, mapped sync, no-match no-op, userinfo without role, creation uses `default_role`.

### Added
- **User authentication source tracking** — every user record now exposes its origin (`local` / `ldap` / `oauth2` / `saml`) plus the originating SSO provider when applicable. New `auth_source` and `sso_provider_id` columns on the `users` table, populated automatically when SSO provisions an account, and backfilled for existing SSO users by migration `024_user_auth_source` (SQLite + PostgreSQL) and an in-place fallback in `_get_or_create_sso_user`. The Users & Groups page gains a colour-coded **Source** column showing both the auth method and the provider name (e.g. `LDAP · Corporate AD`).
- **Wiki: dedicated SSO-Authentication page** covering LDAP / OAuth2 / SAML setup, role mapping, `sync_role_on_login`, `auth_source` tracking, and audit events.

## [2.132] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **HSM provider dropdown empty in Create CA wizard (#80)** — `CAsPage` filtered HSM providers on `is_active && is_connected`, fields that don't exist on the `/api/v2/hsm/providers` response. The dropdown was therefore always empty, displaying "No connected HSM provider" even when an HSM was correctly configured and successfully tested. Now uses the actual `enabled` field returned by the backend (computed as `status === 'connected'`). Test fixture in `CertificatesForms.test.jsx` updated to match the real API contract.

## [2.131] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL backend on DEB/RPM (#78)** — `psycopg2-binary` is now declared in `backend/requirements.txt` so the runtime install pulls the driver automatically. `Test connection` and `Switch to PostgreSQL` no longer fail with `No module named 'psycopg2'` on a fresh DEB/RPM install.
- **SSO callback crash on role auto-update (#79)** — the audit log call after a role change in `api/v2/sso.py` used keyword arguments not accepted by `AuditService.log_action()` (`status='success'`) and passed the username as a positional `resource_type`. Rewritten with the correct kwargs (`action='role_change'`, `resource_type='user'`, `resource_name=<username>`, `username=<username>`, `success=True`). SSO logins that change a user's role no longer raise `TypeError`.
- **PostgreSQL URL examples harmonized** — in-app help, guides and admin docs now show `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/ucm` (consistent with the UI placeholder) instead of mixing in `postgresql+psycopg2://`. Both forms remain accepted by the backend validator.

### Also in this release (carried over from cancelled v2.131-rc)
- **HSM warning is now provider-aware** — the "SoftHSM not detected" banner only shows when SoftHSM is actually the configured provider. Users running OpenBao or a vendor PKCS#11 module no longer see a misleading warning.

## [2.130] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **HSM-backed Certificate Authorities (#77.3)** — the CA's private signing key can now be generated or stored inside an HSM and never leaves it. The Create CA wizard exposes a **Key Storage** toggle (Local / HSM); in HSM mode you can generate a new key in the HSM (RSA-2048/3072/4096, EC-P256/P384/P521) or pick an existing unused signing key. All certificate issuance, CRL generation and OCSP responses for the CA are signed by the HSM. PKCS#12, JKS and raw-key export endpoints return HTTP 409 for HSM-backed CAs. CA list and detail views show an "HSM" badge. In-app help and wiki updated in all 9 UI languages.

### Security
- **`python-dotenv` upgraded to 1.2.2** to pick up the latest CVE patches.

### Notes
- HSM-backed CAs are backed by the existing HSM provider plumbing (PKCS#11, AWS CloudHSM, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS, OpenBao/Vault Transit). Only OpenBao is exercised in CI; the other providers share the same code path but are not yet end-to-end tested.
- In-place migration of existing local CAs to HSM and HSM key rotation for existing HSM CAs are intentionally out of scope and tracked as separate follow-up items.

## [2.129] - 2026-04-21

### Security
- **ACME client and proxy now offer user-controlled SSL verification** — both the ACME client (upstream CA directory) and the ACME proxy (target ACME server) expose `verify_ssl` / `proxy_verify_ssl` toggles persisted via `/api/v2/acme/client/settings`. Default is **on**; the UI shows a warning banner when disabled. The proxy "Test connection" endpoint now uses the persisted flag (no per-request override) and rejects cloud metadata IPs and loopback targets.
- **Outbound HTTP sessions now verify TLS by default** — `utils.safe_requests.create_session()` defaults to `verify_ssl=True`. Callers must opt out explicitly when targeting an internal endpoint with a self-signed certificate.
- **CSRF exemptions narrowed for SSO and mTLS** — previously any `/api/v2/sso/*` or `/api/v2/mtls/*` route was CSRF-exempt. Exemptions are now restricted to the specific public callback/handshake subpaths; admin-write endpoints under those prefixes are now CSRF-protected.
- **WebSocket admin endpoints require `admin:system` permission** — `/api/v2/websocket/clients` and `/api/v2/websocket/broadcast` now require admin scope instead of any authenticated session.
- **Forgot-password endpoint is now rate-limited** to mitigate enumeration and brute-force.
- **API keys linked to deactivated users are now rejected** — `auth/unified.py` checks the `is_active` flag in addition to the key's own validity.

### Fixed
- **Service no longer starts silently when database migrations fail** — `run_all_migrations()` failures now block startup with a clear error instead of leaving the app half-initialized.
- **Database migration runner uses `DATABASE_URL` as single source of truth** — eliminates the SQLite path mismatch that could arise when `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_PATH` disagreed.
- **Database migration target check is now fail-closed** — if the emptiness check on the target database raises, migration aborts instead of continuing. The `_migrations` bookkeeping table DDL is now PostgreSQL-compatible (`SERIAL`/`IDENTITY` instead of SQLite `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`).
- **Audit logs for background tasks no longer appear as `anonymous`** — actions performed without a Flask request context (CRL auto-regeneration, ACME auto-approve, scheduler tasks, startup work) are now correctly labelled `system`, `scheduler`, or `acme`. `anonymous` is reserved for genuinely unauthenticated HTTP requests.

## [2.128.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Service fails to start after upgrading to v2.128 on SQLite installs** — the new v2.128 database migrations did not apply on upgrade and the service stayed in a failed state. Fresh installs were not affected.

## [2.128] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Custom Extended Key Usage (EKU) OIDs when issuing certificates and signing CSRs (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.12)** — the *Issue Certificate* form and the *Sign CSR* modal now expose an "Extra EKUs" multi-select that combines a dropdown of well-known EKUs (Microsoft RDP `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2`, smartcard logon `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2`, document signing, IPsec, Kerberos PKINIT, etc. — 18 catalog entries via the new `GET /api/v2/eku/known` endpoint) with a free-text input that accepts any well-formed dotted OID. The cert_type's default EKUs (e.g. `serverAuth` for server certs) remain locked-in as chips and the extras are merged on top — never replaced. Backend validation (`utils/eku_validation.py`) enforces a 16-OID cap, the `^[0-2](?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*)){1,15}$` OID regex, and explicitly rejects `anyExtendedKeyUsage` (2.5.29.37.0). For CSR signing, if the CSR already carries an EKU extension it is rebuilt with the merged set. Fixes [#76](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/76).
- **Active filter state persisted across reloads** — applying a filter on Certificates, CAs, Audit Logs, Templates, Policies, TrustStore, HSM, RBAC, SSH Certificates, SSH CAs, Users/Groups, or User Certificates now saves the live selection to `localStorage` (one key per filter, e.g. `ucm-filter-certs-status`). Reloading the page or navigating away and back instantly restores the same filter, with no flash of unfiltered data — the new `usePersistedState` hook reads the value synchronously in the React state initializer. Clearing a filter through the UI also removes the corresponding `localStorage` entry, so empty state stays clean. Works alongside the existing named filter presets (which keep using a separate `…-presets` key). Fixes [#57](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/57).
- **Windows quick-install script for SSH CA trust** — the SSH CA setup script endpoint now accepts a `?platform=windows` query parameter and returns a PowerShell (`.ps1`) script that configures the Windows OpenSSH Server to trust the CA (writes the public key to `%ProgramData%\ssh`, locks down ACLs, adds `TrustedUserCAKeys`/`HostCertificate` directives to `sshd_config`, validates with `sshd -T`, and restarts the `sshd` service). Supports both user and host CAs, includes a `-DryRun` switch, and works on the public unauthenticated `/ssh/setup/<refid>` endpoint too. The SSH CA detail panel now shows two download buttons (Linux/macOS `.sh` + Windows `.ps1`) and two Quick Install one-liners (`curl … | bash` for Linux/macOS, `iwr … | iex` for Windows). Fixes [#75](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/75).
- **User UI preferences persisted server-side** — language, theme family, and theme mode are now saved per-user in the database (`users.preferences` JSON column) instead of only in the browser's `localStorage`. New endpoints `GET/PUT /api/v2/account/preferences` (whitelist-validated, admin or self) store the preferences, and `/api/v2/auth/verify` returns them so they are applied on every page load. Logging in from a fresh browser, a different device, or after clearing site data now restores the user's chosen language and theme instead of falling back to the browser locale and default theme. Migration `022` adds the column on both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Fixes [#73](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/73).
- **ACME proxy orders linked to local accounts** — proxy order rows now record which local `AcmeAccount` initiated them (FK `account_id` resolved from the client JWK thumbprint). The proxy order list now displays the account email/short id beside each order, and the account detail "Orders" tab now merges local + proxy orders with a "Proxy" badge so operators can see all activity per account in one place. Migration `021` backfills `account_id` for existing proxy orders by joining on `acme_accounts.jwk_thumbprint`. Fixes [#71](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/71).

### Fixed
- **ACME renewal storm with Let's Encrypt** — `AcmeClientOrder.expires_at` was being set from the ACME order resource's `expires` field (RFC 8555 §7.1.3, ~7 days for LE) instead of the issued certificate's `notAfter` (typically 90 days). The renewal scheduler then re-issued the same certificate every tick, hitting the LE production rate limits. `finalize_order` now stores the leaf certificate's `notAfter`, and migration `020` backfills `expires_at` for all already-issued orders. Fixes [#74](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/74).

### Changed
- **No more compilation toolchain required at install time** — `gcc` and `python3-dev` (DEB) / `python3-devel` (RPM) have been removed from package dependencies. Previously they were needed to build the `twofish` C extension pulled in transitively by `pyjks` (Java KeyStore export). Investigation confirmed `twofish` is only used by pyjks for the BKS UBER keystore format, which UCM never produces — UCM only exports JKS. `pyjks` is now installed via `pip install --no-deps pyjks==20.0.0` in the postinst scripts (with its actual runtime deps `javaobj-py3` + `pycryptodomex` listed in `requirements.txt`), keeping the install pure-wheel and ~30 MB lighter on RPM systems.

## [2.127] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **PostgreSQL 13+ as a native database backend (alongside SQLite)** — UCM now supports PostgreSQL via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/ucm`). When unset, UCM falls back to the bundled SQLite at `UCM_DATA_DIR/ucm.db`. The schema is created automatically on first start; no manual SQL required. The `psycopg2-binary` driver is bundled in DEB/RPM/Docker.
- **Settings → Database** — new UI section showing the active backend (sqlite/postgresql), database size, table count, and migration version. Operators can:
  - **Test** an arbitrary `DATABASE_URL` before switching
  - **Switch** the backend (persists to `/etc/ucm/ucm.env` on DEB/RPM and triggers restart)
  - **Migrate data** between backends in either direction (SQLite → PostgreSQL or PostgreSQL → SQLite)
- **Bidirectional database migration** (`/api/v2/database/migrate`) — backs up the source first, creates the schema on the target via SQLAlchemy, disables FK checks during bulk load (PostgreSQL `session_replication_role`, SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_keys`), intersects source/target columns to handle legacy schema drift, normalizes `memoryview`/JSON values across drivers, and resets PostgreSQL sequences after load. Verified end-to-end with 47 tables / 3800+ rows in both directions.
- **Migration safety checks** — `Test connection` rejects PostgreSQL servers older than 13 (UCM minimum supported version) with a clear message. `Migrate` performs a pre-flight check on the target and refuses (HTTP 409) if `users`, `cas`, or `certificates` already contain rows, with a cleanup hint (`DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;` for PG, file delete for SQLite). On mid-way failure, the source is left untouched and the error message points the admin to the source backup so recovery is straightforward.
- **Documentation** — `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md` and `docs/installation/docker.md` updated with PostgreSQL setup, `DATABASE_URL` reference, and migration workflow. In-app **Help** (Quick Help + Guide) updated for the Database section in all 9 languages.

### Notes
- Docker installs cannot persist `/etc/ucm/ucm.env` from inside the container. After running **Migrate** on Docker, the API returns the target URL and operators must set `DATABASE_URL` in their `docker-compose.yml` / `docker run -e` and restart the container manually.
- The migration runner's `_migrations` bookkeeping table is created on the target if missing (it is bootstrapped outside SQLAlchemy metadata).

## [2.126] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Local ACME refused HTTP-01 / TLS-ALPN-01 for internal domains (CRITICAL for on-prem use)** — The Phase 2 SSRF hardening unconditionally rejected RFC1918 / loopback / link-local / reserved targets in HTTP-01 and TLS-ALPN-01 validators. UCM's local ACME exists precisely to issue certificates for internal infrastructure (`.lan`, `.local`, `.corp`), which by definition resolves to private addresses. The check is now gated by a new `acme.allow_private_ips` setting (default `true`). Operators issuing only for public domains can flip it to `false`.
- **OPNsense import refused LAN hosts** — `import_opnsense.py` rejected any RFC1918 OPNsense host. OPNsense is a LAN firewall by design. Replaced the broad SSRF check with the narrow guard (`validate_url_not_cloud_metadata`) that only blocks cloud metadata services and loopback.
- **Webhooks refused internal targets** — Creating or testing a webhook pointing at an internal Slack-compatible / Mattermost / Teams self-hosted / Jenkins / Gitea / Home Assistant / n8n endpoint was rejected. UCM is on-prem; internal automation is the primary use case. Both `api/v2/webhooks.py` and the legacy `api/v2/settings.py` webhook routes now use the narrow guard.
- **Discovery scans could not include `127.0.0.1`** — Loopback was unconditionally blocked, preventing operators from discovering certificates of services bound to localhost on the UCM host itself. Loopback is now allowed; only link-local / multicast / reserved remain blocked.

### Security
- The narrow SSRF guard (`validate_url_not_cloud_metadata`) still blocks the highest-impact targets in the on-prem context: cloud instance metadata services (AWS `169.254.169.254`, GCP `metadata.google.internal`, Azure, Alibaba) and loopback. These remain rejected for webhook/OPNsense/SSO/ACME-proxy outbound traffic.

## [2.125] - 2026-04-17

### Security
- **Backup format v2 (encrypted container, magic header, Argon2id KDF)** — The backup system now emits a versioned binary container with `UCMB` magic bytes, explicit format version byte, feature flags (gzip on by default), and KDF identifier. Key derivation uses Argon2id (`time_cost=3`, `memory_cost=64 MiB`, `parallelism=4`, 32‑byte output) instead of PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA256 at 100k iterations, providing memory‑hard resistance against GPU/ASIC brute force. Ciphertext is AES‑256‑GCM with a 12‑byte random nonce, and the magic prefix is bound as additional authenticated data so a tampered header fails decryption. If Argon2id is unavailable at runtime, v2 falls back to PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA256 at 600 000 iterations (6× previous). v1 backups remain fully restorable for backward compatibility; restore auto‑detects the format.
- **Backup passwords must be ≥ 12 characters** — Enforced server‑side via `_validate_password`.

### Fixed
- **Backup silently dropped certificate revocation state (CRITICAL)** — The previous `_export_certificates` did not include `revoked`, `revoked_at`, `revoke_reason`, or `archived`. Restoring from a backup silently resurrected revoked certificates as valid, a significant security issue for any CA that had issued revocations. These fields are now exported and restored.
- **Backup excluded 15+ model types** — Previously only 20 categories were exported; SSH CAs, SSH certificates, Microsoft ADCS connections and requests, scan profiles / runs / discovered certificates, certificate approval requests, HSM keys, ACME client orders (including proxy state), SCEP requests, and audit logs were all missing. All are now exported in v2 backups. Restore is implemented for SSH CAs (with private‑key re‑encryption), SSH certificates, Microsoft CAs, scan profiles, HSM keys, approval requests, and ACME client orders.
- **Backup `.ucmbkp` extension rejected by upload validator** — `BACKUP_EXTENSIONS` only allowed `.zip` / `.enc`, breaking restore via the UI for the format the system itself produced. `.ucmbkp` is now accepted.

### Changed
- **Every export call is now wrapped in a `_safe()` helper** — Missing tables (e.g. optional feature models on a minimal install) or transient failures log a warning and return `[]` instead of aborting the entire backup.
- **SSH CA private keys are re‑encrypted with the master key on export and decrypted + re‑encrypted on restore**, matching the pattern used for certificate private keys.
- **Backups are gzip‑compressed before encryption**, reducing container size ~5× on typical installs.

### Testing
- Round‑trip restore verified end‑to‑end via `/api/v2/system/backup/restore`: 60 certs, 9 CAs, 5 policies, 3 SSO providers, 7 custom roles, 6 API keys, 52 trusted CAs restored from live v2 backup (329 KB container, magic `UCMB\x02\x01\x02`).
- Backend: 1483 pass.

### Fixed (ACME)
- **ACME proxy badNonce retry (#70)** — The proxy did not implement RFC 8555 §6.5 nonce retry. Lenient upstream CAs (Let's Encrypt staging/production) accepted stale nonces silently, but strict implementations (Pebble, HARICA, and any CA with strict anti-replay) rejected them with `urn:ietf:params:acme:error:badNonce`, leaving orders stuck pending while authz fetches returned 400. The proxy now detects `badNonce`, extracts the fresh nonce from the error response's `Replay-Nonce` header, and retries the signed request once. Verified end-to-end with Pebble + EAB (custom upstream mode).

### Changed (ACME)
- **ACME domain `auto_approve` is now functional (#69)** — Previously the toggle on ACME Domains and Local Domains was stored in the database and exposed in the UI but never consulted by the ACME service, so every order still required full challenge validation. When `auto_approve=True` is now set on a matching domain entry (exact match or any parent domain, wildcard prefixes stripped), UCM skips HTTP-01/DNS-01/TLS-ALPN-01 validation: authorizations are created directly in the `valid` state, orders move straight to `ready`, and an `acme_auto_approve` audit event is logged. This applies to both order-driven authorizations and RFC 8555 pre-authorizations (`newAuthz`). Only affects local UCM issuance, not the ACME proxy.

### Security / Migration
- **`auto_approve` defaults flipped to `False`** — Historically the column defaulted to `True`, which had no effect because the flag was unused. Now that the flag is honored, existing rows with `auto_approve=True` would silently start skipping challenge validation on upgrade. Migration `019_acme_auto_approve_safe_default` resets every existing `AcmeDomain` and `AcmeLocalDomain` row to `False`. Model defaults and API create defaults are also `False`. Administrators must explicitly opt in per domain after upgrading. A UI warning banner is shown when the toggle is enabled.

### Roadmap
- **PostgreSQL support** — Abstract the data layer so deployments can back UCM with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, for multi-instance HA and larger certificate inventories
- **Environment Variables** — Sync Docker env vars (SMTP, HSM, etc.) to database at startup; track `managed_by` source; mark UI fields as read-only when sourced from environment
- **Policy Enforcement on Protocols** — Apply certificate policies to ACME, SCEP, and EST protocol handlers (currently only enforced on REST API); add CA issuance restriction flags to prevent direct issuance from root/intermediate CAs

---

## [2.124] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy — Let's Encrypt "contact email has invalid domain" (#68)** — The proxy registered its upstream LE account with a synthesized `admin@<FQDN>` address, ignoring the email configured by the admin via `POST /api/v2/acme/client/proxy/register`. On typical installs the FQDN resolves to a private TLD (`.lan`, `.local`, `.internal`), which LE rejects against its Public Suffix List, breaking every proxied order (win-acme, certbot, etc.). The proxy now reads `acme.proxy_email` as the contact address and no longer synthesizes internal addresses.
- **`register_proxy_account` was a no-op** — The endpoint only stored the email in config; actual upstream registration happened lazily on the first client order, using the wrong address. It now validates the email format, rejects non-public TLDs (`.local`, `.lan`, `.home`, `.internal`, `.corp`, `.test`, `.invalid`, `.localhost`) server-side, clears any stale `acme.proxy.account_url`, and triggers real registration against the upstream CA so EAB-required / unreachable-CA / forbidden-domain errors surface immediately. The response now includes the upstream account URL.
- **`unregister_proxy_account` left zombie credentials** — Removed `acme.proxy_email` but not the cached `acme.proxy.account_url`, so the next registration attempt reused a deactivated account. Unregister now cleans all proxy account state.
- **ACME proxy nonce / JWS hangs** — `_get_nonce()` and `_post_jws()` issued requests with no timeout and could hang indefinitely if the upstream was unresponsive. Explicit timeouts added (15 s / 30 s).
- **Wildcard domain lookup used `lstrip('*.')`** — `lstrip` strips characters, not a prefix, so `*abc.example.com` would incorrectly become `example.com`. Replaced with a proper `startswith('*.')` + slice.
- **Upstream response body leaked to clients** — `RuntimeError(f"...: {resp.text}")` in the proxy surfaced raw upstream bodies to end clients. Errors are now logged server-side with a truncated body; clients see only the upstream `detail` field or a generic message.

### Testing
- 5 new unit tests covering PSL validation (accept public, reject private TLDs), email format validation, and mocked upstream registration flow.
- Backend: 1476 pass (+5). Frontend: 450 pass.
- Functional verification on netsuit against LE staging: valid public email registers successfully, private-TLD emails rejected with HTTP 400, unregister fully cleans credentials.



---

## [2.123] - 2026-04-18

### Security (Phase 2 — unified SSRF + error hygiene)
- **ACME directory URL SSRF** — `PATCH /api/v2/acme/client/settings` now validates `directory_url` and `proxy_upstream_url` against cloud-metadata endpoints (AWS `169.254.169.254`, GCP `metadata.google.internal`, Alibaba `100.100.100.200`) and loopback addresses. RFC1918 private ranges remain allowed so internal ACME CAs keep working.
- **OAuth2 discovery SSRF** — `_test_oauth2_connection()` now guards the well-known endpoint URL before issuing the HEAD request, with the same narrow cloud-metadata + loopback policy.
- **SAML metadata SSRF consistency** — `fetch_idp_metadata()` replaced the literal-IP-only filter (trivially bypassed via hostnames) with a unified resolver-aware check. Internal IdPs on private networks remain fetchable; only cloud metadata + loopback are blocked.
- **Error message hygiene** — removed `str(e)` / stack-trace leaks in MSCA CSR submission, SSH CA KRL generation, webhook URL validation, and ACME DNS access testing. Exceptions are now logged server-side and clients receive generic messages.

### Fixed
- **Policy approval self-check bypassed (HIGH)** — `approve_request()` read `request.current_user` (which is always None; Flask's `request` has no such attribute), so the "creator cannot approve own request" guard never triggered. Now uses `g.current_user`.
- **Policy audit trail wrong actor** — `reject_request()` always logged `'system'` as the rejector for the same reason; now logs the real username.
- **Policy `created_by` always null** — `create_policy()` set `created_by = request.current_user` (always None). Now reads from `g.current_user`.

---

## [2.122] - 2026-04-17


### Security (Phase 1 — critical hotfixes)
- **SAML authentication bypass (CRITICAL)** — removed unsigned-XML fallback parser in `/api/v2/sso/saml/callback`. Any `process_response()` exception or validation error now hard-rejects with `saml_validation_failed` instead of trusting attributes from un-verified XML.
- **Webhook SSRF (CRITICAL)** — `POST /api/v2/settings/webhooks` and `POST /api/v2/settings/webhooks/:id/test` now validate destination URL via `validate_url_not_private()`, rejecting private/loopback/link-local/metadata IPs (the parallel `/api/v2/webhooks` endpoints were already protected; the legacy duplicate is now on par).
- **P12 password leak via URL (HIGH)** — `GET /api/v2/certificates/:id/export` and `GET /api/v2/user_certificates/:id/export` refuse `password=` query params and PKCS12/PFX/JKS formats. Password-bearing exports must use `POST` with a JSON body (matches what the UI already does) to keep secrets out of reverse-proxy / web-server access logs.
- **Brute-force protection activated (HIGH)** — `init_rate_limiter(app)` is now wired up in `create_app()`. Auth/login endpoints are rate-limited (default 30 rpm, configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_RPM`). Previously the rate-limit module was fully implemented but never registered as middleware.
- **Rate limiter** — added `/.well-known/est/` to the protocol whitelist bucket (EST endpoints get the same permissive limits as ACME/SCEP instead of falling through to the default).

### Fixed
- **Auto-renewal crash (CRITICAL)** — `services/auto_renewal_service.py` referenced columns that do not exist on the `Certificate` model (`not_before`, `not_after`, `ca_id`, `status`, `superseded_by`). The 12-hour scheduler pass silently crashed on every run, so nothing was ever auto-renewed. Rewrote the query + renewal logic against the real schema (`caref`, `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `revoked`, `archived`, `source`), and old certificates are now marked `archived = true` when a successful renewal is issued.

---


## [2.121] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed (ACME code review — 7 bugs)
- **EAB validation** — fixed `SystemConfig.set()` call on non-existent method (EAB validation was always failing, blocking external account bindings)
- **Manual renewal endpoint** — `renew_certificate()` now returns `(bool, str)` tuple as caller expects (manual renewal via API no longer crashes)
- **ACME server base URL** — service instantiated per-request instead of cached globally, fixing stale base URLs behind reverse proxies or multi-hostname setups
- **key-change endpoint (RFC 8555 §7.3.5)** — properly decode and verify inner JWS signed with the new key (was unconditionally failing)
- **HTTP-01 / TLS-ALPN-01 SSRF protection** — reject challenge validations against domains resolving to private/loopback/link-local IPs
- **DNS-01 exact match** — TXT record validation uses exact equality over `rdata.strings` instead of substring match (prevents false positives)
- **Order/Authorization POST-as-GET** — enforce account ownership per RFC 8555 §7.4/§7.5 (reject cross-account reads with 403)

---

## [2.120] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy directory resilience** — Proxy `/directory` endpoint no longer fails with 500 when the upstream ACME server is unreachable; account registration is now lazy (only when placing orders), with proper timeouts and detailed error messages (#66)
- **ACME auto-renewal crash** — Fixed `create_order() missing 1 required positional argument: 'email'` error in the renewal service; rewrote renewal to use current AcmeClientService API with proper email sourcing, challenge verification, and order finalization (#66)

---

## [2.119] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **CSR excluded from certificates list** — Signed CSRs no longer appear in the certificates list, stats, or compliance endpoints; only records with an issued certificate are shown
- **SAN auto-generation from CN** — When signing a CSR that has no SAN extension, UCM now auto-adds the CN as a DNS SAN (and subject emailAddress as RFC822Name SAN), ensuring modern browser/TLS compatibility
- **MSCA UPN auto-fill improvement** — EOBO enrollee UPN now also tries the CSR subject emailAddress when SAN email is empty; UPN field is required when EOBO is enabled

---

## [2.118] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **ACME proxy settings UX overhaul** — Unified mode selector (Let's Encrypt Staging / Production / Custom), inline account status indicator, connection test, and CA/account mismatch detection (#64)
- **Collapsible ACME sections** — Custom ACME Directory and Proxy EAB Credentials sections with chevron indicators and bordered containers for better discoverability (#64)

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy stale account recovery** — Auto-re-registers upstream account when CA returns "Account is not valid" (e.g., LE staging cleanup); applied to all 8 proxy operations (#65)
- **ACME proxy empty URL fallback** — Proxy now falls back to default upstream URL when stored URL is empty, preventing crashes after custom mode reset (#65)
- **ACME proxy custom mode credential clearing** — Switching to custom mode now properly clears stale upstream URL and credentials (#64)
- **ACME challenge initiation** — Moved challenge initiation to authorization phase for correct RFC 8555 flow (#63)

### Documentation
- Added OpenBao HSM and ACME proxy documentation

---

## [2.117] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **OpenBao HSM provider** — Native Transit Secrets Engine integration for OpenBao/HashiCorp Vault; supports RSA, ECDSA, AES key types with full key lifecycle management (#60)
- **ACME proxy EAB support** — External Account Binding fields for upstream ACME proxy connections (#61)

### Fixed
- **ACME proxy authorization URL rewriting** — `get_order` and `finalize_order` now correctly proxy authorization URLs, preventing stateless clients from bypassing the proxy (#62)

---

## [2.116] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Multi-select filters with chips** — All page filters now support multi-select with visual chips across certificates, CAs, SSH, discovery, audit, users, operations, CSRs, reports, and policies pages (#58)
- **CA multi-select filters** — CA type and status filters on CAs page now support multi-select with proper filtering logic
- **Copy-to-clipboard** — Detail panels across pages now include clipboard copy buttons for key fields
- **Keyboard shortcut tooltips** — Toolbar buttons show keyboard shortcuts on hover
- **Table density toggle** — Configurable row density with persistent storage per page
- **Filter presets** — Tables support filter preset keys for quick filter switching
- **Accessibility** — Added aria-labels to all icon-only buttons across the frontend

### Fixed
- **CAs page status filter was dead code** — Filter dropdown was rendered but completely ignored in filtering logic; now properly filters Active/Expired CAs
- **Dashboard duplicate quick actions** — Quick action buttons were duplicated in header and below header; consolidated into single header bar with RBAC guards
- **SSH status display and stats** — Corrected status field reading and statistics computation on SSH certificates page
- **MultiSelectFilter prop mismatch** — Fixed prop names (`filterType` vs `type`) causing filters to silently fail in ResponsiveDataTable
- **ACME proxy async DNS setup** — `respond_challenge` refactored to use background thread for DNS propagation, preventing Traefik timeouts on slow DNS providers (PR #59, @C0DEbrained)

### Security
- **pytest bump 9.0.2 → 9.0.3** — Fixes CVE-2025-71176

---

## [2.115] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **ACME settings: text inputs saved on every keystroke** — Directory URL, contact email, and EAB fields fired an API call on each keystroke, causing validation errors mid-typing (e.g., "h" rejected as non-HTTPS). Text inputs now save on blur instead (issue #56).

### Added
- **ACME proxy upstream URL** — New UI field and API endpoint to configure the upstream ACME directory URL for the Let's Encrypt proxy. Previously only configurable via database.
- **4 new backend tests** for proxy upstream URL PATCH/GET validation.

---

## [2.114] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **ACME Proxy: Account not found after KID fix** — Proxy `new-account` returned a hardcoded static account ID that didn't exist in the database after the KID verification refactor (issue #55). Now creates real persistent `AcmeAccount` records with proper JWK storage and deduplication via thumbprint. Certbot and other ACME clients work correctly again with the proxy.

### Added
- **ACME proxy protocol tests** — 6 new regression tests covering account creation, deduplication, KID-based JWS verification, and wrong-key rejection to prevent future proxy breakage.

---

## [2.113] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **ACME Private Network Support** — Removed SSRF filter that blocked ACME challenge validation on private networks (10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x), which is the primary self-hosted use case
- **CSR Intermediate CA Signing** — Signing a CSR as "Intermediate CA" now correctly creates a Certificate Authority record instead of leaving it as a regular certificate ([#54](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/54))

### Added
- **Configurable Lockout Settings** — Account lockout duration and max login attempts are now configurable from the Settings page instead of hardcoded constants; applies to password, LDAP, and 2FA authentication
- **Admin User Unlock** — New `POST /api/v2/users/{id}/unlock` endpoint allows administrators to unlock locked-out user accounts

---

## [2.112] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **SSH Certificate Authority** — Full SSH CA support: create ED25519/RSA/ECDSA SSH CAs, sign host and user certificates with configurable validity and principals, manage and revoke SSH certificates; RBAC-enforced with 6 dedicated permissions; dashboard widget shows SSH certificate stats; curl-friendly setup script endpoint (`/api/v2/ssh/cas/:id/setup-script`) for one-command client trust configuration
- **SSH Import** — Import existing SSH CAs (public+private key) and SSH certificates with full validation; supports OpenSSH key formats
- **HTTPS Certificate Picker** — Settings HTTPS certificate selection now uses a searchable modal with pagination instead of a limited dropdown; supports filtering by name, subject, or issuer across all certificates

### Security
- **Session Fixation Prevention** — Added `session.clear()` before session assignment in OAuth2, SAML, LDAP, and mTLS login paths
- **Export Password Protection** — Certificate/CA export endpoints now accept POST with password in request body instead of GET with password in URL query string
- **EST Password Hashing** — EST authentication password stored with `generate_password_hash()` instead of plaintext; seamless migration for existing deployments
- **LDAP Settings Allowlist** — LDAP configuration endpoint restricted to known keys, preventing arbitrary SystemConfig injection
- **LIKE Injection Prevention** — Search wildcards (`%`, `_`) properly escaped in groups, users, templates, truststore, and user-certificates endpoints
- **Self-Approval Prevention** — Users cannot approve their own certificate requests
- **OPNsense Credentials** — Moved from persistent `localStorage` to session-scoped `sessionStorage`
- **RBAC Hardening** — Added audit logging and try/except to all RBAC and policy write operations; Discovery profile edit/delete buttons now gated by permissions

### Fixed
- **Dependency Update** — Bumped `cryptography` 46.0.6 → 46.0.7 (CVE-2026-39892)
- **SSH i18n** — Navigation menu items and help content translated in all 8 languages

---

## [2.111] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **PKCS7/PKCS12 Decode Support** — Certificate decoder now handles DER/PEM PKCS7 bundles (.p7b/.p7c) and passwordless PKCS12 files in addition to standard PEM/DER certificates; returns chain info when multiple certs found in a bundle

---

## [2.110] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **ACME Auto-Supersede** — Automatically revoke previous certificates with reason 'superseded' when a new certificate is issued via ACME finalize (controlled by `revoke_on_renewal` setting)

### Fixed
- **DER File Upload Detection** — All file upload handlers (SmartImport, Cert Tools, mTLS) now detect PEM vs DER by content (`-----BEGIN` header) instead of file extension; fixes corrupted DER uploads for `.crt`/`.cer` files
- **CA Template in Certificates Page** — Remove incorrect "Certificate Authority" template from Certificates page template dropdown; CAs should only be created from the CAs page

---

## [2.109] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Multiple CDP/OCSP/AIA URLs** — Support multiple CRL Distribution Point, OCSP responder, and AIA URLs per CA with add/remove UI in the CRL/OCSP page; migration converts single-URL columns to JSON arrays with backward compatibility (#49)
- **Certificate Practice Statement (CPS)** — Per-CA CPS URI and Policy OID configuration; embedded in issued certificates as CertificatePolicies extension (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.4); toggle, URI input, and OID input in CRL/OCSP page (#49)
- **RFC 5280 Extensions** — PathLength constraints, NameConstraints (permitted/excluded subtrees), PolicyConstraints, InhibitAnyPolicy, Subject Information Access (SIA), OCSP Must-Staple
- **RFC 6844 CAA Checking** — Validate CAA DNS records before certificate issuance; NameConstraints enforcement on certificate creation; ACME account lifecycle (deactivate)
- **ACME Enhancements** — Order management, newAuthz endpoint, External Account Binding (EAB) support; EST csrattrs endpoint; SCEP GetNextCACert and renewal support
- **TSA (RFC 3161)** — Full Time Stamping Authority: backend API (`/api/v2/settings/tsa`), protocol endpoint (`/tsa`), frontend management page with signing CA, policy OID, hash algorithms, and accuracy settings
- **Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962)** — CT log URL management, enable/disable toggle, auto-submit on certificate creation, manual CT submission endpoint, SCT extension parsing and display in certificate details
- **OCSP Delegated Responder (RFC 5019)** — API to assign/remove delegated OCSP responders per CA with OCSPSigning EKU validation; eligible responder listing; UI section in CRL/OCSP page
- **In-App Help Translations** — 208 help content files across 8 languages (fr, de, es, it, ja, pt, uk, zh) for all 26 sections; per-section lazy loading with English fallback

### Security
- **6 CRITICAL fixes** — CSRF token rotation, password complexity enforcement, account lockout on all auth paths, audit log integrity, session security hardening, input sanitization
- **14 HIGH fixes** — Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, generic error messages (no username enumeration), secure session cookie attributes, WebAuthn origin validation
- **18 MEDIUM fixes** — Content Security Policy headers, X-Frame-Options, request size limits, backup file access controls, password history enforcement

### Improved
- **Help Button** — Translated "Help" button text in all 9 languages
- **CT Settings UX** — Configure CT log URLs first, then enable — more intuitive workflow

---

## [2.108] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **CRL Auto-Regeneration** — Fix scheduler silently returning no CAs: `has_private_key` is a Python `@property`, not a DB column; `filter_by(has_private_key=True)` returned empty results; replaced with Python-side filtering (Issue #52)
- **Centralized Logging** — Module-level loggers (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`) had no handlers; added root logger configuration in `app.py` with RotatingFileHandler (native) or stdout (Docker); all scheduler/service logs now visible in `/var/log/ucm/ucm.log`

### Improved
- **CRL/OCSP Page Redesign** — Replace text toggle headers with language-independent icon+tooltip headers; merge Status into CA Name column; merge Last Update + Next Update into single stacked Updates column; add `compact` column flag to ResponsiveDataTable for fixed-width toggle columns (48px); table reduced from 9 → 7 columns

---

## [2.107] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **SoftHSM Status** — Fix HSM providers always showing "Disabled" in the UI: backend returned `status` string but frontend expected `enabled` boolean; add `enabled` field to `HsmProvider.to_dict()` (Discussion #26)
- **Key Encryption (Docker)** — Ensure `/etc/ucm/` directory exists with correct ownership in Docker entrypoint; improve error message with Docker-specific hints when permission denied writing master.key (Discussion #26)

### Added
- **CDP Auto-Enable** — Automatically enable CRL Distribution Point (CDP) on newly created CAs when a Protocol Base URL or HTTP protocol server is configured; users no longer need to manually enable CDP per CA (Discussion #26)
- **SoftHSM Auto-Register** — Automatically create an `SoftHSM-Default` HSM provider in the database when Docker entrypoint initializes a SoftHSM token; the provider appears immediately in the HSM page (Discussion #26)

---

## [2.106] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **ACME Proxy** — Fix challenge validation staying pending when using certbot: proxy now only exposes dns-01 challenges (http-01/tls-alpn-01 cannot work through a proxy); add clear error messages when upstream CA has no dns-01 challenge, DNS provider is not configured, or no matching order found; replace all silent exception handling with proper logging (fixes #51)

### Added
- **ACME Proxy EAB** — Support External Account Binding for upstream CA registration (required by HARICA, Sectigo, etc.) via `acme.proxy.eab_kid` and `acme.proxy.eab_hmac_key` settings; auto-detect when upstream requires EAB and show clear error

### Security
- **Dependencies** — Update requests 2.32.5 → 2.33.1 (CVE-2026-25645), cbor2 5.8.0 → 5.9.0 (CVE-2026-26209), cryptography 46.0.5 → 46.0.6 (CVE-2026-34073)

## [2.105] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **ACME Proxy** — Add missing route decorators on `authz`, `order`, `finalize`, `cert` endpoints (were unreachable dead code — certbot failed after `new-order`); add POST-as-GET empty payload validation (RFC 8555 §6.3); fix error responses to use `urn:ietf:params:acme:error` URN format with `application/problem+json` (RFC 7807); add `revoke-cert` and `key-change` stub endpoints (advertised in directory but missing) (fixes #50)
- **ACME Main API** — Add `Cache-Control: no-store` to all ACME responses (RFC 8555 §8); add POST-as-GET payload validation on order, authz, cert endpoints; fix `revoke-cert` success response missing `Replay-Nonce`, `Cache-Control`, `Link` headers
- **ACME Services** — Wrap all bare `db.session.commit()` calls with try/except + rollback + logging across acme_service, acme_proxy_service, acme_client_service; add input validation for identifiers in proxy `new_order()`
- **OCSP** — Add debug logging to silent CA cert parsing exception in issuer hash lookup
- **SCEP** — Use module-level logger instead of `current_app.logger` for consistency

### Fixed
- **Settings API** — `system_name`, `base_url`, `date_format`, `show_time` were missing from the GET response and PATCH allowed keys; frontend fields now properly persist (credit: f1lint, PR #47)

---

## [2.103] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Protocol URL regression** — OCSP and AIA CA Issuers URLs were incorrectly generated with `https://host:8443/...` instead of `http://host:8080/...` when enabling features; now uses configured FQDN and HTTP protocol port
- **Protocol URL auto-repair** — Toggling OCSP/CDP/AIA on now automatically regenerates any URL that incorrectly uses `https://`; migration 013 fixes existing bad URLs on upgrade
- **Localhost protection** — Protocol URL generation returns an error instead of generating unusable `localhost` URLs; FQDN or Protocol Base URL must be configured first

### Changed
- **CRL/OCSP page** — Removed `window.location.origin` fallbacks; URLs only shown when properly configured by backend; shows "URL not configured" message when enabled but no URL available
- **Help guides** — CDP and AIA sections now mention FQDN/Protocol Base URL prerequisite

---

## [2.102] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **DEB/RPM packaging** — Added `gcc` and `python3-dev` as package dependencies to fix install failures on Ubuntu 24.04 and other minimal systems where C compiler is not present (needed to compile `twofish` extension for JKS export)
- **API key creation** — Fixed "Permissions are required" error when creating API keys from the UI; added permission scope selector (Full Access, Read Only, Read & Write, Certificates Only) to the creation form ([#46](https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/46))

### Changed
- **Documentation** — Added AIA CA Issuers to README, API reference, in-app help, and wiki

---

## [2.101] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **AIA CA Issuers** (RFC 5280 §4.2.2.1) — Public `/ca/{refid}.cer` and `.pem` endpoints serve CA certificates for chain building; CA Issuers URL embedded in Authority Information Access extension of issued certificates (#45)
- **AIA toggle & URLs** — CRL/OCSP page now has AIA CA Issuers toggle per CA with copy-to-clipboard URLs alongside CDP and OCSP

### Fixed
- **showWarning crash** — Creating wildcard certificates no longer crashes with "showWarning is not defined" toast error
- **Admin approval bypass** — Admin users now bypass approval policies when issuing certificates; previously admins were incorrectly subject to approval workflows
- **Wildcard policy default** — Wildcard certificate policy now seeded as inactive by default (was incorrectly active, blocking wildcard creation for all users)

---

## [2.100] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Migration system** — Upgrades from old versions (pre-v2.52) no longer fail; baseline migration now creates all tables unconditionally with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` instead of skipping schema for existing installs
- **Missing database columns** — Added fallback for columns missing after partial upgrades: `key_type`, delta CRL fields, `request_data`, EOBO fields, SAN fields on discovered certificates

### Added
- **docker-compose.simple.yml** — Minimal compose file for Portainer and quick deployments (just image, ports, volume)

### Changed
- **Docker Compose fixes** — Removed non-existent `development` build target from dev compose, removed deprecated `FLASK_ENV` (Flask 3.x), fixed nginx healthcheck and `depends_on` condition in prod compose

---

## [2.99] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **JKS (Java KeyStore) export** — Export certificates and CAs as password-protected JKS files with optional CA chain inclusion; available in all export modals, detail panels, and certificate converter tool

### Fixed
- **Orphan certificate re-chaining** — SKI/AKI backfill now fixes certificates with stale CA references (e.g. after OPNsense migration) by matching AKI to existing CA SKI

---

## [2.98] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Security: socket.io-parser CVE-2026-33151** — Updated to 4.2.6, also fixed ajv ReDoS, flatted DoS, minimatch ReDoS, rollup path traversal (0 npm audit issues)

### Changed
- **Docker: HTTP port 8080** — Added missing HTTP port mapping for CRL/CDP and OCSP public endpoints to all Docker examples (docker-compose.hsm.yml, README, DockerHub, quickstart, installation docs)
- **Documentation** — Complete rewrite of features section across README, DockerHub README, and ucm.tools website to reflect all actual features (EST, ADCS, Discovery, Backup/Restore, Policies, Webhooks, etc.)
- **Website screenshots** — Updated all screenshots to dark mode with realistic data

---

## [2.97] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Certificate CA filter** — Filtering certificates by CA now works correctly; frontend was using nonexistent `ca_id` field instead of `caref`
- **Orphan certificate detection** — Orphan count and filter now properly compare `caref`/`refid` instead of missing `ca_id`
- **ACME order serialization** — Fixed `AcmeOrder.to_dict()` crash caused by referencing `self.expires_at` instead of `self.expires`
- **Trust store detail panel** — Subject and issuer fields now display correctly using actual API response fields
- **Trust store search** — Search now works on `subject`/`issuer` fields instead of nonexistent `subject_cn`/`issuer_cn`
- **Certificate subtitle** — Floating detail window now extracts issuer CN from full DN string
- **CA parent name** — CA history subtitle now resolves parent name from parent_id instead of missing `parent_name` field

---

## [2.96] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Timezone not applied on login** — All login endpoints (password, 2FA, mTLS, WebAuthn, LDAP) now return timezone, date_format, and show_time settings so the frontend applies them immediately without requiring a page refresh
- **Consistent date formatting** — Replaced 13 raw `toLocaleString`/`toLocaleDateString` calls with centralized `formatDate()` across 8 frontend files

---

## [2.95] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **HTTPS certificate chain** — Apply managed certificate now includes full CA chain (leaf + intermediates + root) in https_cert.pem
- **EST enrollment chain** — simpleenroll, simplereenroll, and serverkeygen now return full CA chain in PKCS#7 response (RFC 7030 §4.2.3)
- **mTLS trust file** — mtls_ca.pem now includes parent CA hierarchy for intermediate CA trust

---

## [2.94] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Microsoft CA in-app documentation** — Help content and guide for MSCA integration, EOBO, connection setup
- **Wiki: Microsoft CA Integration** — Full wiki page covering connections, auth methods, EOBO, API reference

### Fixed
- **ACME EAB HMAC key input** — Field was not accepting typed input due to controlled component bug

---

- **ACME External Account Binding** — EAB support per RFC 8555 §7.3.4 for CAs requiring pre-registration (ZeroSSL, HARICA, Google Trust)
- **ACME custom server** — Configure any RFC 8555-compliant CA directory URL (not just Let's Encrypt)
- **ACME key type per order** — Each certificate request can specify its own key type (migration 010)

### Changed
- **In-app help** — Updated ACME guide with ECDSA/EAB/custom server documentation, certbot & acme.sh examples
- **Wiki** — Updated ACME-Support.md with custom CA table, EAB instructions, RFC compliance list

### Security
- **pyasn1** 0.6.2 → 0.6.3 — CVE-2026-30922 (HIGH)
- **pyOpenSSL** 25.3.0 → 26.0.0 — CVE-2026-27459 (HIGH), CVE-2026-27448 (LOW)

---

## [2.91] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **RFC 5280 SAN compliance** — All code paths (CSR upload, import, MSCA, smart import, discovery) now extract and store all 4 SAN types: DNS, IP, Email (RFC822Name), URI
- **CSR import SAN storage** — Fixed `str(list)` → `json.dumps()` for proper JSON serialization of SANs
- **CSR Email SAN handling** — Emails in CSR SANs are now correctly stored as RFC822Name instead of being misclassified as DNS names
- **Certificate creation** — URI SANs now properly saved to database; URI: prefix correctly parsed
- **sign_csr() extensions** — SubjectKeyIdentifier and AuthorityKeyIdentifier now added as fallback when missing from CSR (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.1/§4.2.1.2)
- **SAN critical flag** — SAN extension now marked critical when certificate subject is empty (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.6)

- **FreshestCRL URL** — Fixed delta CRL URL to use `ca.refid` instead of `ca.id` matching CDP route pattern
- **OCSP POST validation** — Content-Type `application/ocsp-request` now validated on POST requests (RFC 6960 §4.2.2)
- **CSR signature verification** — Upload and import endpoints now verify CSR signature before accepting (RFC 2986 §2.2)
- **Certificate import** — SANs now extracted and stored when importing certificates via file upload

### Added
- **Discovery SAN columns** — `san_emails` and `san_uris` columns added to discovered certificates (migration 009)

---

## [2.90] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **ADCS badge** — Certificates signed by Microsoft CA now show a purple "ADCS" tag in the certificate list
- **EST badge** — Certificates issued via EST protocol now show a yellow "EST" tag in the certificate list

---

## [2.89] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **SubCA CDP/OCSP embedding** — SubCA certificates now embed parent CA's CRL Distribution Point and OCSP URLs in extensions (Fixes #39)
- **Certificate CA filter crash** — Filtering certificates by specific CA caused 500 error due to using non-existent `ca_id` column instead of `caref` FK (Fixes #41)
- **DN subject field order** — Reordered all forms (CAs, Certificates, CSRs) and detail displays to follow OpenSSL standard order: C → ST → L → O → OU → Email (Fixes #40)

---

## [2.88] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS cert import completely rewritten** — Previous code used 6 non-existent Certificate model fields (`cn`, `org`, `status`, `issuer_cn`, `not_before`, `not_after`, `cert_id`); now uses correct columns (`refid`, `descr`, `subject`, `subject_cn`, `issuer`, `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `source`, etc.)
- **ADCS cert import extracts SANs, AKI, SKI** — Full certificate metadata parsed and stored, matching UCM standard cert creation pattern
- **ADCS CSR update** — Populates `crt` field on original CSR record (converts CSR → full cert) instead of setting non-existent `status`/`cert_id` fields

---

## [2.87] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS cert import "Incorrect padding"** — Handle certsrv base64-encoded DER (missing padding), full PEM, and PEM-wrapping fallback; robust cert parsing for all ADCS return formats

---

## [2.86] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS cert bytes serialization** — `certsrv` returns `bytes` from `get_cert()`, `get_existing_cert()`, `get_ca_cert()`; now decoded to `str` for JSON responses and DB storage

---

## [2.85] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS CSR signing crash** — Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'CSR' from 'models'`; CSRs use the `Certificate` model (no separate CSR class exists)
- **ADCS request status check** — Same CSR→Certificate fix for pending request polling

---

## [2.84] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS CSR signing robustness** — certsrv import in exception handler no longer masks real errors; string-based error classification runs first, typed exceptions used only if available
- **ADCS error visibility** — 500 responses now return actual error message instead of generic "Internal server error"; all error paths log with full stack trace (`exc_info=True`)
- **ADCS DB resilience** — All `db.session.commit()` calls wrapped in try/except with rollback to prevent cascading failures
- **CSR validation** — Empty CSR data and bytes-vs-string mismatches now caught before submission

---

## [2.83] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **ADCS template parsing** — Extract template name from compound ADCS values (`E;TemplateName;1;...`) instead of using raw string
- **ADCS CSR signing 500 error** — Proper certsrv exception handling (CertificatePendingException, RequestDeniedException) with full stack trace logging
- **ADCS submitted_by tracking** — Fixed username access (`g.current_user` instead of non-existent `request.current_user`)
- **Expiry alerts ignore disabled setting** — Scheduler now uses NotificationService (DB-backed) instead of in-memory settings; disabling alerts in UI actually stops emails
- **Expiry emails use custom template** — Alert emails now go through NotificationService with configured email template

---

## [2.82] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **CDP URLs now use HTTP protocol** — CDP URL generation in CA API was hardcoded to HTTPS (`request.host_url`), now uses `get_protocol_base_url()` which respects HTTP protocol port configuration
- **CRL/OCSP page shows actual URLs** — Distribution Points section now displays the real CDP/OCSP URLs stored on the CA (with HTTP protocol) instead of hardcoded `window.location.origin` (HTTPS)
- **Migration updates existing CA URLs** — Existing CAs with HTTPS CDP/OCSP URLs are automatically migrated to HTTP when HTTP protocol port is enabled
- **Expiry alerts respect disabled setting** — Scheduler now uses NotificationService (DB-backed) instead of in-memory ExpiryAlertSettings; disabling alerts in UI actually stops emails
- **Expiry emails use custom template** — Alert emails now go through NotificationService which applies the configured email template
- **Missing i18n keys** — Added `details.subjectAltNames`, `common.enable`, `common.disable` across all 9 locales

---

## [2.81] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **HTTP Protocol Server for CDP/OCSP** — Optional plain HTTP server (port 8080 by default) serving only CDP and OCSP endpoints, avoiding TLS verification loops when clients fetch CRLs
- **Refid-based CDP URLs** — CDP URLs now use CA refid (UUID) instead of sequential numeric IDs, preventing CA enumeration; legacy numeric IDs still supported
- **Protocol Base URL Setting** — Configurable base URL for protocol endpoints (CDP/OCSP) in Settings UI; auto-detects HTTP port when enabled
- **HTTP Protocol Port in UI** — Port configurable via Settings > General with validation (0=disabled, 1024-65535)
- **Global JSON Error Handlers** — All API errors (400, 404, 405, 413, 500) now return consistent JSON responses instead of HTML

### Fixed
- **Integer Overflow Crash** — Requesting certificates with absurdly large IDs no longer causes 500; returns 400 JSON
- **Unhandled Exception Logging** — All uncaught exceptions are now logged with full stack trace and return safe JSON error

---

## [2.80] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Approval Workflow Enforcement** — Certificate policies with `requires_approval` now actually block issuance until approved; approved requests auto-issue certificates with stored request data
- **Smart Policy Matching** — Approval policies evaluate request data (CN, SANs) against rules; wildcard policy only triggers for `*.domain` certificates, not all requests
- **X.509 Extensions for CA & Discovery** — Shared extension parser displays full X.509 details in CA detail and Discovery certificate views (reuses certificate extension components)

### Fixed
- **CDP/OCSP in Certificates (#39)** — CRL Distribution Points and OCSP URLs now embedded in all issued certificates (direct creation, CSR signing, SCEP, EST) when enabled on the CA
- **EST Protocol** — Implemented missing `CAService.sign_csr_from_crypto()` and `get_certificate_chain()` methods; all 5 EST endpoints now functional
- **Auto-Renewal Service** — Fixed same missing CAService methods that caused auto-renewal to crash at runtime
- **Scheduler Crash** — Removed reference to non-existent `SMTPConfig.admin_email` in expiry alerts and discovery notifications (used `smtp_from` instead)
- **CRL/OCSP URL Format** — Fixed frontend displaying wrong CDP/OCSP URLs; auto-generates correct URLs when toggles are enabled
- **Overbroad Seed Policies** — Deactivated "Code Signing" demo policy that had no narrowing rules and would block all certificate creation

---

## [2.77] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **X.509 Certificate Extensions** — Full extension display in certificate detail view: Basic Constraints, Key Usage, Extended Key Usage, Subject Alternative Names (DNS/IP/Email/URI/UPN/DirName), Subject Key Identifier, Authority Key Identifier, CRL Distribution Points, Authority Information Access, Certificate Policies, Name Constraints
- **EKU OID Name Mapping** — 18 common Extended Key Usage OIDs resolved to human-readable names (IPsec, Microsoft, Netscape SGC, etc.) instead of "Unknown OID"
- **Typed SAN Badges** — Subject Alternative Name entries displayed with colored badges per type (DNS, IP, Email, URI, UPN, DirName)
- **Critical Extension Indicator** — Red badge for extensions marked as critical

---

## [2.76] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **FK Cascade on Delete (#39)** — All DELETE endpoints now properly handle foreign key dependencies (CAs cascade CRL/OCSP records, certificates/policies clean up ApprovalRequests), with try/except + rollback preventing HTTP 500 on constraint failures
- **Protocol Middleware Exemptions (#39)** — CDP, OCSP, SCEP, ACME, and EST endpoints now exempt from FQDN redirect, HTTPS enforcement, and safe-mode middleware (was causing protocol clients to get HTML login page)
- **SPA Catch-All (#39)** — Added `/cdp/` and `/ocsp/` to SPA exclusion list so protocol endpoints aren't intercepted by React Router
- **i18n Completeness** — Replaced ~160 hardcoded English strings with `t()` calls across certificate discovery, website, and various UI components; all 9 locales updated (3086 keys each)

---

## [2.75] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Delta CRL Support (RFC 5280 §5.2.4)** — Generate delta CRLs containing only recent revocations, with DeltaCRLIndicator (CRITICAL), FreshestCRL on base CRLs, dedicated CDP endpoint, scheduler auto-generation, and full frontend management (toggle, detail, interval selector)
- **PDF Reports Tab** — PDF report templates with custom builder, purple icons, grid card layout, and scheduling support
- **Roadmap** — Added market comparison gaps (Clustering/HA, K8s/Helm, PQC, SSH, CMP, Key Archival, Code Signing) to README

### Fixed
- **Security Audit (76 findings)** — Fixed 38 issues across 6 audit phases: XXE/SSRF protection, str(e) leak prevention, RSA-512/1024 removal, ACME JWS bypass, EST timing-safe auth, SCEP decrypt fix, RBAC operator permission trimming, discovery rate limiting
- **PKI Protocol Hardening** — CSR signature verification, cert validity clamping to CA, parent CA expiry check, atomic ACME nonces, SCEP serial fix, EST reenroll subject check, serverkeygen fail-safe
- **RBAC** — Correct delete: permissions on DELETE endpoints, operator role trimmed to 23 permissions
- **Frontend Quality** — ARIA overlays, dashboard valid count, pie chart backend data, barrel exports, theme-safe colors, i18n completeness
- **Reports** — Sidebar tab layout, centered content matching Settings pattern
- **CDP** — Cache-Control and Last-Modified headers on CRL/delta CRL distribution points
- **SAN Normalization** — Certificate SAN field accepts both string and array formats
- **Black CVE** — Bumped black 26.1.0 → 26.3.1 (CVE-2026-32274)

### Security
- Content-Disposition filename sanitization
- Generic error messages (no internal detail leakage)
- Rate limiting on discovery scans
- Unique index on CRL numbers (race condition prevention)

---

## [2.74-dev] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **MS CA Client Error Handler** — Fixed NameError (`verify` → `cafile`) in connection error cleanup
- **Certificate/CA Export Decryption** — Export endpoints now properly decrypt private keys before export (was exporting encrypted data)
- **Managed Cert Selection** — CertificateInput managed mode correctly fetches cert PEM + key via export endpoint
- **Cryptography Deprecation Warnings** — Replaced `not_valid_before`/`not_valid_after` with UTC-aware variants across all services

---

## [2.73] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **CertificateInput Component** — Unified cert/key input with 3 modes: paste PEM, upload file (auto-detect via SmartImport), select from managed certificates
- **MS CA File Upload** — Client certificate for MS CA mTLS can now be uploaded or selected from managed certs (not just pasted)
- **Converter Password Guardrails** — PKCS12 input requires password, PKCS12 output requires password; clear error messages

### Changed
- **SSL Converter Refactored** — Uses SmartParser (same engine as Smart Import) instead of duplicated parsing logic

- **MS CA SSL Verify** — `session.verify = False` when SSL verification disabled
- **Dashboard Chart Height** — Fixed `-1` height error with explicit container sizing
- **CertificateInput Select Import** — Fixed import path for SelectComponent

---

---

## [2.68] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **ACME Wildcard CSR Mismatch** — Wildcard certificate finalization failed with "CSR does not specify same identifiers as Order" because CN used stripped base domain instead of exact wildcard domain (fixes #34)
- **ACME Certificate Import** — Let's Encrypt certificates imported with missing metadata (no issuer, SANs, key algorithm, signature algorithm). Now delegates to CertificateService for proper chain splitting, base64 encoding, and full field extraction (fixes #35)
- **Infinite API Loop on User Click** — Clicking a user in management page triggered endless /certificates requests due to unstable useEffect dependencies; fixed with useRef guard
- **mTLS Certificate Hover Disappear** — Certificate item disappeared on hover due to native title tooltip; replaced with aria-label
- **mTLS Generate Missing Name** — API response for mTLS certificate generation was missing the `name` field
- **Reports Grid Spacing** — Report cards grid had no margin spacing; wrapped in space-y-4

---

## [2.67] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **SSO CA Bundle Round-Trip Bug** — CA certificate PEM content was returned as boolean in API responses, causing PEM to be destroyed on re-save (fixes #33 follow-up)
- API now returns actual PEM content for ca_bundle fields instead of boolean presence indicator
- Update endpoint rejects non-string ca_bundle values to prevent data corruption

---

## [2.66] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- 4 new i18n keys across all 9 locales

### Security
- **SAML Silent Fallback Removed** — SAML metadata fetch no longer silently falls back to `verify=False` (MITM risk)

### Fixed
- All 5 outbound HTTPS requests in SSO module now respect SSL verification settings (3 OAuth2, 1 SAML, 3 LDAP)

---

## [2.65] - 2026-03-09

### Security
- **Unbounded Compliance Query** — `/api/v2/certificates/compliance` now processes certificates in batches of 200 instead of loading all into memory (DoS prevention)
- **LIKE Wildcard Injection** — Certificate search now escapes `%` and `_` wildcards in LIKE queries
- **HTML Injection in Emails** — Discovery notification emails now HTML-escape profile names
- **per_page Cap** — List certificates endpoint now caps `per_page` at 100

- **Compliance Stats API** — `/api/v2/certificates/compliance` returns aggregate grade distribution

### Fixed
- **OCSP Dashboard Status** — Dashboard OCSP badge was always gray; `/ocsp/status` endpoint was hardcoded to `enabled: true` without checking DB — now queries actual `ocsp_enabled` flags
- **OCSP Detail Panel** — Detail panel showed global OCSP status instead of selected CA's `ocsp_enabled` state
- **OCSP Stats** — `/ocsp/stats` now returns real response counts from `ocsp_responses` table instead of hardcoded zeros

---

## [2.63] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Auto-SAN from CN** — Common Name is automatically included as SAN (DNS for server/combined, Email for email/combined certs) with visual indicator in the form
- **Wildcard base domain suggestion** — When CN is `*.example.com`, suggests adding `example.com` as additional SAN since wildcards don't cover the bare domain
- **Subject email auto-SAN** — Subject DN email field automatically included as Email SAN for email/combined certificates
- Backend auto-includes CN and subject email as SANs during certificate generation

---

## [2.62] - 2026-03-06

- **EST RFC 7030 Compliance** — `/simplereenroll` now requires mTLS only (no longer accepts Basic auth); `/serverkeygen` encrypts private key with client password when available

---

## [2.60] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

---

## [2.59] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **Audit Log Binding Error** — Fixed `sqlite3.InterfaceError` when signing CSRs; dict was passed as positional arg to audit logger instead of string
- **Missing i18n Keys** — Added 12 missing translation keys across all 9 locales (`common.deleted`, `common.dismiss`, `common.exportFailed`, `common.generating`, `common.createdBy`, `acme.renew`, `certificates.cnRequired`, `certificates.localityPlaceholder`, `certificates.statePlaceholder`, `csrs.generateFailed`, `operations.selectCA`, `userCertificates.exportError`)

---

## [2.56] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **ACME/CSR Certificate Compatibility** — Certificates signed from CSRs (ACME, SCEP) now include Extended Key Usage (`serverAuth`) and populate CN from SAN when subject is empty, fixing Edge/Chrome rejection while Firefox accepted them

---

## [2.55] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

## [2.50] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Login architecture redesign** — complete rewrite of the authentication flow with state machine (init → username → auth → 2fa/ldap), automatic method detection, and zero-interaction mTLS auto-login
- **mTLS auto-login** — client certificate authentication now happens entirely in the TLS handshake via middleware; no explicit POST required, browser cert → session → auto-redirect to dashboard
- **AuthContext session check on all routes** — removed the `/login` skip guard; `checkSession()` now always calls `/auth/verify` on mount, enabling mTLS auto-login discovery
- **`sessionChecked` state** — new boolean in AuthContext exposed to components, prevents flash of login form during session verification
- **Enhanced `/auth/methods` endpoint** — returns `mtls_status` (auto_logged_in/present_not_enrolled/not_present), `mtls_user`, and `sso_providers` in a single call

### Changed
- **mTLS middleware** — clean rewrite with `_extract_certificate()` helper (DRY), `g.mtls_cert_info` for cross-endpoint reuse, proper stale session handling
- **LoginPage** — removed cascade login logic; each auth method is standalone with proper state transitions; WebAuthn auto-prompts after username entry if keys detected
- **App.jsx `/login` route** — shows `PageLoader` while session is being checked, then redirects if already authenticated

### Fixed
- **mTLS peercert injection** — custom Gunicorn worker (`MTLSWebSocketHandler`) extracts peercert DER bytes into WSGI environ
- **OpenSSL 3.x CA names** — ctypes hack in `gunicorn_config.py` to send client CA names in CertificateRequest
- **Timezone-aware datetime comparison** — fixed crash in `mtls_auth_service.py` when comparing naive vs aware datetimes
- **Serial number format mismatch** — normalized hex/decimal serial matching in `mtls_auth_service.py`
- **Scheduler SSL errors at startup** — added 30s grace period before first scheduled task execution
- **Stale sessions blocking mTLS** — middleware now validates existing sessions before skipping certificate processing
- **`checkSession()` false positive** — now properly checks `userData.authenticated` before setting `isAuthenticated=true`

---

## [2.49] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **mTLS login endpoint** — `login_mtls()` was missing its `@bp.route` decorator, causing 404 on client certificate login
- **ACME account creation** — added missing `POST /acme/accounts` route; "Create Account" button was returning 404
- **ACME account deactivation** — added missing `POST /acme/accounts/<id>/deactivate` route
- **CRL generate** — `crlService.generate()` now calls the correct `/crl/<caId>/regenerate` backend endpoint

### Changed
- **CHANGELOG** — complete rewrite with accurate entries for all versions from 2.1.1 through 2.48 (extracted from git log)

---

## [2.48] - 2026-02-22

- **TOTP 2FA login flow** — complete two-factor authentication with QR code setup and verification at login
- **Experimental badges** — visual indicators for untested features (mTLS, HSM, SSO) in Settings and Account pages
- **ucm-watcher system** — systemd path-based service management replacing direct systemctl calls; handles restart requests and package updates via signal files
- **Auto-update mechanism** — backend checks GitHub releases API, downloads packages, triggers ucm-watcher for installation
- **Pre-commit checks** — i18n sync, frontend tests (450), backend tests (1364), icon validation — all run before every commit

### Changed
- **Versioning scheme** — migrated from Semantic Versioning (2.1.x) to Major.Build (2.48) for simpler release tracking
- **Single VERSION file** — removed `backend/VERSION` duplicate; repo root `VERSION` is sole source of truth
- **Service restart** — centralized via signal files (`/opt/ucm/data/.restart_requested`) instead of direct systemctl calls
- **Branch rename** — development branch renamed from `2.1.0-dev`/`2.2.0-dev` to `dev`
- **RPM packaging** — systemd units renamed from `ucm-updater` to `ucm-watcher` for consistency with DEB
- **Centralized `buildQueryString` utility** — all 10 frontend services now use `buildQueryString()` from `apiClient.js`

- **PEM export** — use real newlines in PEM concatenation
- **Export blob handling** — pages now correctly handle `apiClient` return value (data directly, not `{ data }` wrapper)
- **`groups.service.js` params bug** — was passing `{ params }` to `apiClient.get()` which silently ignored query parameters

### Security
- **1364 backend security tests** — all authentication, authorization, and RBAC endpoints tested
- **Rate limiting verified** — brute-force protection on all auth endpoints confirmed via tests
- **CSRF enforcement** — all state-changing endpoints verified to require CSRF tokens
